An Australian Bay Class patrol boat that was gifted by the Australian government to the Sri Lankan government is scheduled to arrive at the Colombo Port tomorrow (24) morning, the navy said.
The Sri Lankan Navy (SLN) took delivery of the Bay-class patrol boat, donated by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS), at a flag-transfer ceremony in Cairns, Australia on 30 March.
Australian media reports said that, the vessel, rechristened ‘SLNS Oshadi’ is agile and with a range, speed and boarding capability that mean they will be well-suited to enhancing the Sri Lankan Navy’s efforts to disrupt people smuggling venture.
According to technical specifications provided by manufacturer Austal Ships, Bay-class vessels have a maximum range of 1,000 n miles at a top speed of 20 kt. They can carry 12 crew and two landing craft.
SLNS Oshadi will be joined by another patrol boat following a pledge made by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in November 2013 to donate the vessels to help enhance the SLN's maritime security capacity.
