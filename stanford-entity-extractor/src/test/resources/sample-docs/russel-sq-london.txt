Consumers can view mini-statements and find their nearest ATM with the service.
Barclays customers will be given demonstrations on how to make balance transfers and check their bank account at a host of mobile banking clinics.

The organisation is running six events in London's Russell Square this week to give consumers the lowdown on how to get the best out of the service.

Other advantages of the package include the option to view current account mini-statements and services to enable people to find their nearest branch or ATM, as well as a currency converter.

Sean Gilchrist, digital banking director at Barclays, said the group was keen to get out and about and show customers just how easy the system is to use.

He added: "Not only is mobile banking convenient, research has also shown that people who use mobile banking are more in touch with their bank balance and have a better grasp on their finances."

Earlier this month, the organisation announced a two-year fixed rate bond that pays up to 3.55 per cent gross per annum on balances more than Â£50,000.
