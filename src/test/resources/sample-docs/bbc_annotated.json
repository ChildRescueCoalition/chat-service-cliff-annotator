        "text": " Dutch unease over tobacco lobbying Every year the tobacco industry provides around 2.4bn euros to the Dutch economy How close is too close when it comes to conversations between governments and the tobacco industry? In the Netherlands, politicians are being accused of allowing the powerful tobacco lobby to exercise undue influence over smoking policy. In recent years while most countries have been tightening anti-smoking legislation, the Netherlands has partially reversed some of its laws - allowing people to smoke in some bars again and cutting funding for anti-smoking organisations. Now there are allegations that this could be due to improper links between the politicians and the tobacco industry, and experts are warning it could have a potentially deadly impact on the nation's health. Three years ago, like many others across Europe, the Dutch government outlawed smoking in bars. But over the past six months, under pressure from licence holders, ministers in the Netherlands have been rolling back the restrictions. Now, small bars with just the owner working are allowed to let customers have a cigarette with their beer. One bar manager, who wishes to remain anonymous, told us the government's change of policy probably saved her business. \"When the ban came in people didn't come here anymore but now it's OK and look: most people in here are smoking. Maybe it's bad to smoke, but people should be allowed to do what they want.\" Politicians defend their policy changes on the grounds of personal freedom. Anne Mulder is a member of the ruling VVD party in the Dutch Parliament and involved in designing the Dutch health policy. He agreed to speak to us on behalf of the government. \"Oh I know a lot of people in the anti-smoking lobby hate me but I am a liberal and as a liberal I believe people should be free to choose if they want to smoke or not.\" The World Health Organisation's international tobacco control treaty bans any communication that might allow the tobacco industry to influence government policy. But Mr Mulder admits the health department does hold meetings with the tobacco lobby. \"It's a legal product, I think it's right I speak to everyone and that's what I'm doing. I don't have any problem speaking to the lobbyists. If you want to make policy you have to speak to people on all sides then make your own decision.\" It's an argument that Professor Onno van Schayck from the University of Maastricht completely rejects. \"If you want to control malaria you don't invite the mosquitoes to negotiate with you on these issues. This is so illogical. It is absolutely irresponsible what they're doing, it's not a health policy not at all.\" While it is getting easier for smokers to find a bars that won't turf them outside for a cigarette, government cutbacks are making it harder than ever for those who are trying to help them quit. Researchers predict that without tougher anti-smoking policies and more help for those who want to give up over the next 30 years, almost a million people in the Netherlands will die prematurely due to tobacco-related diseases. But the economic crisis is forcing the government to implement cross departmental budget cuts. The Stiviro smoking cessation clinic in The Hague has had its government funding cut completely. \"People are on their own, that's the message the government is giving out,\" says Dr Savitri Ritoe, who runs the clinic. \"It's fine to say people should be free to choose but if you're addicted you're not free and you can't choose to stop because you have a disease and that's why they need help.\" Bergen Op Zoom is a small town on the Dutch west coast. It's home to one of the biggest Philip Morris factories in the world. My taxi driver tells me its presence is crucial to the local economy. \"Every family who lives here has someone who works at Philip Morris. In my family there are three.\" The sprawling plant employs 1,400 workers. At reception stands a colourful arrangement of cigarette boxes displaying the company's most successful brands. It reminds me of a proud peacock showing off its magnificent tail feathers. Inside, on the factory floor, the machines are buzzing. Everywhere you look cigarettes are being processed and packaged. Last year, Dutch smokers spent more than 4bn euros on tobacco products. Mathijs Peters, a lobbyist for Philip Morris, says 80bn cigarettes were produced in the factory last year. \"We do share our views with the government on legislation that affects our company. \"Regulation should be effective when it comes to reducing the harm caused by our products but at the same time it should allow us to compete for adult share of the market. \"In some areas we would actually like the government to do more. At the moment the minimum age is 16 but we know that is not strictly enforced.\" Tobacco is big business in the Netherlands. Every year the industry provides around 2.4bn euros to the Dutch economy; roughly half of that comes from Philip Morris. The Dutch government denies this financial clout is allowing the tobacco industry to exercise any power over policy. Nevertheless, as the anti-smoking cutbacks continue so will the cynicism, concern and calls for the ministers to demonstrate that they are acting with people's health interests at heart."

        "text": " Listening in for the healthy hum Monitoring devices are being put in bee hives across Scotland as part of a project to keep an eye on their health. The monitors record temperature and use a microphone to record the hum the bees make while working and resting. Already the project has started to show the many different hums bees use to co-ordinate their work. The project is also helping to work out which environmental forces and factors are behind the decline in bees and other pollinators. He said the desire to get a better idea of what was happening inside a colony came to him after a few bad experiences with hives on the verge of swarming. Mr Evans knew of the work done in the 1950s by BBC sound engineer and beekeeper Eddie Woods, who created a device that analysed the sounds made by bees in a hive. Mr Woods claimed that more than 90% of the inspections beekeepers made of their hives were unnecessary because, most of the time, the bees were fine. In those cases, all a beekeeper did when he looked through the combs was upset the bees and stunt honey production. To fine tune his beekeeping, Mr Woods produced a device called the \"apidictor\" that helped spot when hives needed help because they were sick, running low on stores or close to swarming. The downside of using the apidictor was that a beekeeper still had to visit a hive and insert a microphone to listen to the hum within. Mr Evans' monitor updates the apidictor using modern digital signal processors and algorithms designed to recognise different hums. \"Every job a bee does inside a hive makes a slightly different noise,\" he said. \"So if we can listen to the mass of sound within the hive and possibly dissect that, we can find out a lot about the inner dynamics within the hive. \"We started off looking for swarm prediction but when we began trawling through the data we noticed some other features. The monitor can give an indication of the strength of the hive, the fitness of the hive, how fast the hive is building, their intent to swarm and other such things.\" The monitor is a flat black box about the size of an iPhone that regularly measures the temperature of the brood inside a hive and the sound of the bees. This data is regularly sent to a separate master unit, which collates responses from several monitors. It also keeps an eye on rainfall and external temperatures. Every so often the master unit sends the information it has received from all the other monitors, plus weather data, back to a server via the mobile network. While developing the monitor, Mr Evans has been refining the analytical tools that dissect the different hums in a hive. He hopes these will help the many scientists researching the problems that afflict bees, by giving them hints about what was happening before a colony failed. Mr Evans is working with the Scottish Beekeepers Association, and the little black boxes are now sitting in about 70 hives across the region. The data gathered by the monitors is also aiding the research of Chris Connolly from the University of Dundee, who is taking part in the Insect Pollinators Initiative - a five-year, 10m project which aims to understand what is causing populations of these insects to dwindle. Bees were a good indicator of the health of that larger insect population and were much easier to study as they lived inside a hive, said Mr Connolly. \"We have monitors in hives to record how the colony builds in strength throughout the season,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we can correlate that to events that occur on each individual hive, whether a particular treatment knocked bees back or not, and whether the weather and other factors also play a part. \"Bees are so important because they and other insect pollinators produce 30% of the food on our plates.\" Mr Evans was also hopeful that regular monitoring of hive hums would pinpoint when bees were sick and what disease had hit them. \"We've noticed that ill colonies sound different,\" he said. \"We haven't managed to characterise which diseases leads to which sounds but that's work in progress.\" As well as helping beekeepers, the work of the hive monitor could also give great detail about a largely unexplored facet of the honey bee's life. \"We know less about acoustic communication than any other type of communication in bees,\" said Alexandros Papachristoforou, a biologist at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki who studies bees. \"Researchers tend to look at visual communication or chemical communication. They don't pay much attention to sound.\" The hum in a hive is generated by the bees shivering their wings and abdomen as they go about their work in the colony. Although bees lack ears, the hum is believed to be very important to the co-ordination of hive activity, because bees often modify wax comb to be a better conductor of vibration. Sound was hugely important inside the hive where vision was useless and chemical signals took time to propagate, said Mr Papachristoforou. \"It's a huge field we must pay attention to,\" he said. \"There will be a lot of surprising findings coming out of it.\""

        "text": " UK workers 'richer but stressed' Britons are richer and more stressed than when the Queen came to the throne, a report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development has found. The CIPD report found the workforce in the UK has increased by six million, thanks to an influx of women since 1952. However the total number of hours worked has stayed the same - driven by a big rise in part-time working. Despite that reduction the CIPD claims work related stress has increased. One cause for this, according to the report, is the increase in unemployment. Measured by the number of people claiming the job-seekers allowance, unemployment has increased from 2.2% of the workforce in 1952, to 5.5% on the most recent figures. More worryingly the report found that the number of households where nobody earned had increased dramatically from 4% to 18.8%. \"With the threat of unemployment an underlying concern even in good times, people do not seem much happier about their working lives and many exhibit the symptoms of work-related stress,\" said Dr John Philpott, chief economic advisor for the CIPD. The report argued that the increase in the number of workless homes was linked to changes in the way we work, with fewer men in the workforce and more households with two earners. However, with just 75% of men employed compared to 96% in 1952, this increased the number of households with no breadwinner. On the other hand the female working age employment rate has risen from 46% to 66%. Changing world of work, 1952-present Average Weekly Hours (all) % workforce self-employed However the report accepted that people have become more productive over the last 60 years. Despite the same number of hours being worked the value of the goods and services produced by the economy has quadrupled. However this increase has come with increased pay inequality and a significant shift in the kind of work being carried out, the CIPD said. The number of people in manufacturing jobs fell from 8.7 million in 1952 to just 2.5 million today while the number in managerial, professional and technical jobs has nearly doubled to 44% of the workforce."

        "text": " Winter freeze for UK house prices House prices started the new year with a slight decline - falling by 0.2% in January compared with the previous month, according to the Nationwide. The building society, the first to report on January's prices, valued the average home at 162,228. The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 0.6% in January, from 1% in December, it added. It repeated its outlook that prices would move sideways or modestly lower in the coming months. \"Given the challenging conditions prevailing in late 2011, with the UK economy contracting in the final three months of the year, it is not surprising that house price growth softened at the start of 2012,\" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. \"The economy is not expected to gather much momentum until the second half of 2012 at the earliest, which suggests that labour market conditions and buyer sentiment may be slow to improve.\" The three-month on three-month measure saw values rise by 0.3% in January, the same as December, the Nationwide data showed. The figures come shortly after the Land Registry said that house prices in England and Wales fell by 1.3% last year, to an average of 160,000. The only region where prices rose was London, up by 2.8% to an average price of 345,000. Prices fell fastest in the north-east of England where they dropped by 7.1%, bringing the regional average down to 99,000 for a home. More detail on the state of the London market came in an annual trading update from the estate agent franchise chain, Winkworth. It said that prices for \"prime\" London properties had continued to rise throughout 2011, with family houses in strong demand. But its statement added that prices for flats and houses in less prime areas had been \"broadly stable\". Winkworth said there had been signs of more properties becoming available in early 2012 everywhere in London except central London, where instructions remained very low. \"We expect to see prices in central London continuing to move upwards as buyers from the Far East and the eurozone, looking to London as a safe haven for investment, fuel demand,\" the firm said."

        "text": " Pension scheme availability drops The trend of final-salary pension schemes closing to both new joiners and current staff appears to be continuing. The proportion of final-salary schemes still open to new recruits in the private sector fell last year from 18% to 16%, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and the Pensions Regulator said. They also found 24% of schemes had stopped existing members building up more pension, up from 21% in 2010. The figures were published by the regulators in their 2011 annual review. A further 58% of schemes still allowed their existing members to build up more pension but did not allow new members to join. \"The proportion of memberships in open schemes fell from 34% to 31% in 2011 while the proportions closed to new members and new accruals rose from 60% to 62% and from 5% to 6% respectively,\" the review, known as the Purple Book, said. However, it also shows that the closures have not gone quite as far as claimed in similar, but more limited, surveys carried out in the past year by the Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) or the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). In the past year the finances of final-salary schemes have taken a big lurch for the worse. Their collective deficit stood at a record 255bn at the end of 2011, compared with a surplus of nearly 22bn at the end of 2010. \"Scheme funding for the PPF-eligible universe of defined-benefit pension schemes deteriorated markedly between end-March and end-December 2011,\" the Purple Book said. The PPF exists to provide a safety net for pension scheme members whose employer has gone bust, leaving the scheme with a significant deficit. Thus the chance of the PPF being called on to stage a rescue depends on the solvency of a company as well as the solvency of its pension scheme. The regulators' publication pointed out that in the 2010-11 financial year, there was a 46% drop in the number of schemes entering the PPF's formal assessment process for a possible bailout. That was mainly due to fewer firms going bust, as the economy continued to grow after emerging from recession in 2009. This led to the insolvency rate among UK companies staying stable at just 0.9% through to the third quarter of 2011. However, the PPF and the Pensions Regulator warned that the situation might now be deteriorating. \"Since [the end of March 2011] there has been a slowdown in the global and UK economies and this could have a negative impact on the PPF,\" it said. The regulators' annual review of 6,432 final-salary schemes in the private sector covered 98% of the total. Between them they have 12 million active, deferred and retired members."

It warned that as many as 1.6 million jobs in the US were at risk if action was not taken against such policies. China is the fastest-growing source of US auto parts imports. \"China's blatant use of illegal government subsidies and a web of predatory trade practices on a massive scale are undercutting companies in the US auto supply chain,\" said Scott Paul , Executive Director of AAM. \"It's essential that federal action be taken to challenge these abuses before they completely undermine the job recovery underway in the US auto industry.\" The accusation comes just days after US President Barack Obama announced the set up of a new government body to investigate unfair trade practices in countries such as China. Trade relations between the US and China, the world's two largest economies, have deteriorated in recent years. US policymakers and businesses have accused China of keeping the value of its currency artificially low in a bid to help its exporters, a move they say gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage. There have been calls in the US to impose duties on Chinese imports in order to provide a level playing field for US-based manufacturers. \"We must be aggressive on trade enforcement, especially as China ramps up subsidies in strategic industries like auto parts,\" said Senator Sherrod Brown. However, there are fears that any such move may result in a full-blown trade war between the two nations."

The legislation, which would bring a fundamental reorganisation of the service, has encountered opposition from peers and various groups. But ministers will later table amendments aimed at quelling unrest. These will include giving more powers to the health watchdog and doing more to encourage medical research. Through the Health and Social Care Bill , Health Secretary Andrew Lansley is proposing the biggest shake-up since the NHS was founded in 1948. The British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nurses and the Royal College of Midwives have all opposed the proposals, with some critics claiming they are unworkable and amount to \"backdoor privatisation\". This led Prime Minister David Cameron to \"pause\" the proposed shake-up in April last year. The bill returns to the House of Lords next week and the government is publishing several amendments aimed at bolstering support. One states that the health regulator, Monitor, will have the power to require that healthcare providers supply \"integrated services\". For instance, hospitals would have to work more closely with district terms after patients are discharged. Another stipulates that medical research should be a \"core function\" of the NHS, to allow it to keep pace with foreign competitors And another amendment promises patients a greater say in how health services are commissioned. In a further effort to appease critics concerned about accountability, an amendment will \"explicitly clarify that the secretary of state retains ministerial responsibility to Parliament for the provision of the health service in England\". On the ground, changes are already being made to pave the way for the new system provided by the NHS bill to start in 2013."

Neville Gabie was artist-in-residence for the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) while the site was built from October 2010 to 9 January, when it was handed over to Games organisers Locog. \"I had been shown some visualisations of how the park would look,\" he said. \"The similarity with that and Bathers at Asnieres struck me immediately.\" Georges Seurat's famous painting, which is housed in London's National Gallery, is a famous 19th Century impressionist masterpiece. But it was not just the physical resemblance of the riverbanks from both images that struck Gabie. \"Seurat's artwork was painted [in 1884] when France really embraced being a republic, when it had become acceptable to paint ordinary urban, working-class people with factories in the background,\" he told the BBC. \"The PR for the Olympic Park is that's it's a public park for people, but instead of being a post-industrial landscape, it has big, iconic sporting venues,\" he said. This struck a chord with him, and he realised that his version, Freeze Frame, could have social parallels with the original. Gabie's next thought was who would populate his iconic photograph, so he ensured that his time on the site was spent \"following the characters working in the park\". \"I know them all pretty well now,\" he said, adding that the people in his image all worked in the northern part of the Olympic Park.

Gabie blogged about how painstaking it was to get the exact shot he wanted, which was taken in June 2011. \" I had no idea that what seemed like such a simple idea would prove to be so complex - in fact a logistical nightmare!\" he wrote. \"Just getting the equipment and kayak on to the park through security and getting everyone from their various sites to the one location was more stressful then I thought possible. \"To get everyone, including the boats on the water in exactly the right position for the one single moment of the photograph took an age. When Steve's dog Buddy was still, then the boats were drifting off course, or a digger would appear on the opposite bank.\" Gabie, who was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1959, trained in sculpture at the Royal College of Art and is resident in the UK. His work includes photography and sculpture and he was previously artist-in-residence for a 500m shopping, leisure and residential centre in Bristol and was also part of an artists' and writers' programme at Halley Research Station in Antarctica. He is now working on pieces inspired by his time at the Olympic site, having tried to \"see as much as possible while making my research films\". The artist said he was now making his ideas \"visible\" through films and sculptures. One of his works features a Turkish Cypriot woman who drove a bus which ferried workers around the Olympic Park. \"It's a fantastic story, she was such an inspirational character - and she was also an obsessive swimmer,\" he said. His 25-minute film is of her swimming the length of her bus route - just under one mile - in the Olympic pool in the Aquatics Centre. The film's length was determined by the time it took her to do the swim, and it also included footage of her at work with her colleagues. \"There is a hidden cohort of 30 bus drivers who work on the park,\" the artist added. \"I think their commitment of time, the hours they do is extraordinary.\" Another film, which features 239 portraits of the people who built the stadium, lasts 9.58 seconds, the exact length of Usain Bolt's world record 100m. It is currently showing at View Tube , a viewing platform opposite the Olympic site. Blink and you will miss it - the film has one person per frame - but Gabie said: \"You can make people out in it surprisingly.\" It is not yet on his website as he said he is adding his artworks gradually. He also made a film based on him being in the stadium by himself. \"When you stand in a massive, empty stadium on your own, how do you make sense of a space so big and quiet?\" he said. \"In the light of how much activity will be taking place there, how can you measure the scale of it?\" In the end, he decided to film himself sitting in as many seats as he could manage, dressed in full builder's gear of high-visibility vest, hard hat and steel toe-capped boots. \"I spent 69 hours there, and sat on about 40,000 seats - it had a total of 69,000 seats when I filmed it.\" It can now seat 80,000 spectators. This work resulted in three films. One was in real time, one was in time-lapse photography and the third was slightly speeded up. As well as being exhibited at View Tube, the works will also be shown at Newham Leisure Centre in the Olympic borough. Gabie is also working on several sculptural objects, which he said are based on: \"Bits from the Velodrome, tools and so on.\" He also tried to walk in a straight line across the Park and will do an artwork inspired by this. \"I'm working now with the Olympic Park Legacy Company, doing a big publication and hopefully will have another exhibition in November,\" he added."

        "text": " West Bank pair 'imprisoned girl' The Israeli authorities have charged an Israeli-Arab couple with imprisoning their daughter for nine years at their home in the West Bank town of Qalqilya. According to an indictment, Baraa Melhem had been locked in a bathroom or other small rooms since the age of 11. She was only let out at night to clean the house, do laundry and cook. Her father, Hassan, and stepmother are accused of abusing a minor, unwarranted imprisonment and attempting to pressure a person to take their own life. Mr Melhem was arrested by Palestinian security forces in Qalqilya and handed over to the Israeli authorities, while his wife was arrested in Israel. According to the indictment filed at Petah Tikva District Court on Tuesday, Ms Melhem was imprisoned between the ages of 11 and 20. She was forced to sleep on a blanket with no mattress and was let out of her locked room only to help with the housework. She was also beaten by her father, and told by both him and her stepmother that it would be better if she killed herself, according to the indictment. Ms Melhem was rescued by Palestinian police on 21 January after an aunt notified them. A police spokesman said she was in a \"deplorable\" condition. Hala Shreim, a social worker who accompanied police on the rescue, said Ms Melhem was found in the bathroom, which had a tiny window, wrapped in a blanket and wearing clothes so old that they were disintegrating. She is now living with her mother, Maysoun, in the West Bank. She divorced Mr Melhem when their daughter was four, and told social workers he made up excuses about why Ms Melhem was never around. \"I have joy now. My life has begun,\" Ms Melhem told the Associated Press two days after her release. \"I don't hate my father. But I hate what he did to me. Why did he do it? I don't understand.\" Ms Melhem said she was first locked up in a bathroom after she ran away from home when she was 10. Police brought her home, and her father forced her to sign a statement saying she did not want to go to school. She said her father had threatened to rape her until she became pregnant if she tried to escape, and that he would then have used the pregnancy to accuse her of shaming the family and justify killing her. He regularly beat her with electric cables and sticks, and poured cold water on her when she asked for her mother, she added. Ms Melhem said she was given bread, oil and an apple every day, and kept sane by listening to a small radio that she was allowed to keep. She added that her half-brother and half-sister, who were mentally disabled and not sent to school, were also not allowed to leave the house when their father was not home, although their conditions were better."

The bonuses, averaging A$8,500, were based on the length of service. Some workers received A$30,000 to A$100,000 each, Australian media reported. The company was sold to Ventura, another transport company, for A$400m. \"You know we've got employees that stretch over 40 years, so it is a pretty nice thing to do,\" Mr Grenda's son, Scott, told ABC News. Mr Grenda, who is also the managing director of the company, said his father was sad about selling the business and wanted to show his gratitude to the staff for their service. \"A business is only as good as its people and our people are fantastic,\" said the senior Mr Grenda, who has been dubbed the ''best'' and ''most generous'' boss in Australia. \"We have had people here who are second generation, and one fellow in the same job for 52 years.'' The employees were surprised and overwhelmed by the gesture, Australian media reported, with some even calling their banks to ask if there had been a mistake in their statements. The Herald Sun newspaper reported that all the staff would keep their jobs under the new management. One bus driver identified only as John told ABC radio that Mr Grenda was ''a generous person and a true gentleman''."

        "text": " Pakistan jets pound 'militants' About 20 suspected insurgents have been killed in attacks by Pakistani jets near the Afghan border, officials say. They say that the airstrikes were in response to an ambush by the Taliban on Tuesday in which at least eight soldiers were killed and 25 injured. Local military officials say that a Taliban leader, Maulvi Moinuddin, was killed but there has been no independent confirmation of his death. The strikes took place in the Jogi area of the Kurram tribal region. Correspondents say that the latest violence reduces the chances of exploratory talks between the two sides. The fighting comes at a time when Pakistan is having to defend itself from claims that its security services are directly assisting the Taliban in Afghanistan. At the same time it is fighting Taliban Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants based in north-west Pakistan. The TTP, al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban movement fighting Western forces in Afghanistan are all entrenched in Pakistan's north-western tribal areas. A series of military offensives has failed to disperse them. In addition to the strikes in the Jogi area, Pakistani jets also hit militant positions in the nearby Mamozai area in the Orakzai tribal region, officials say. They say that at least 12 TTP militants and six Uzbeks were killed in the strikes. \"Local TTP commanders Mullah Toofan and Maulvi Moinuddin's hideouts were targeted and destroyed,\" a local military official told the Reuters news agency. A local TTP spokesman said that both commanders were still alive. Militants have been active in the Kurram tribal agency for several years. Last week at least 23 people were killed in clashes between soldiers and militants in the area."

        "text": " Bid to overturn welfare defeats The government will seek to overturn seven defeats inflicted by the House of Lords to its Welfare Reform Bill later. Ministers will urge the Commons to reject peers' amendments to the bill, including those to disability allowances proposed on Tuesday. They will also rule out Labour calls to scrap a 26,000 benefits cap in favour of variable limits for different localities, calling them \"unworkable\". Labour says the government needs to create jobs before cutting benefits. Far-reaching changes to welfare entitlements are needed, ministers argue, to help people out of dependency on the state, increase incentives for work and make the benefits system fair to both claimants and taxpayers. But campaigners say the proposals - which ministers also hope will save billions - risk pushing already vulnerable people into further hardship and distress. MPs will decide on Wednesday whether to back amendments to the bill made during its passage through the Lords, or throw them out - re-introducing aspects of the proposed legislation rejected by peers. Ministers, led by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, say they intend to overturn the following measures agreed by the Lords: The government suffered its latest defeat on Tuesday when a coalition of crossbench and Labour peers - supported by two Conservatives and seven Lib Dems - voted to limit a proposed reduction to the lower rate of the \"disability element\" of Child Tax Credits. A crossbench amendment tabled by Baroness Meacher calling for the lower rate to be at least two-thirds of the value of the higher rate - which ministers want to raise to 77 a week - was passed by 16 votes. The government says it wants to target support at the children with the highest care needs - and say there will be transitional protection so those already in receipt of the benefit will not lose money. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne MP said Labour was determined to force the government to change the bill. \"Welfare to work needs jobs - and this bill doesn't create a single one,\" he said. \"Instead it cuts support for people trying to do the right thing, like mums trying to go back to work and families trying to save, and quite frankly it crosses a line of basic British decency.\" Ministers say the public backs the principle of not paying any household more in benefits than the average weekly wage of working families. BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Duncan Smith would offer some transitional help, including aid for \"vulnerable families\" hit by the cap, to prevent children's education being disrupted. He may also suggest a period of grace before the cap is imposed for some who have worked much of their lives. \"Some senior Lib Dem peers who've opposed the government's plans are ready to look closely at these proposals to see if they meet their concerns,\" our correspondent added. Changes agreed by the Commons must return to the Lords for approval, raising the prospect of a stand-off between the two Houses on some issues. The process will continue until both Houses agree on the final text of the bill. Anticipating this, Welfare Minister Lord Freud told peers on Tuesday \"he did not think we have seen the last of the bill\"."

        "text": " Special needs education review The Department of Education is planning to scrap the statements which guarantee extra help to pupils with special education needs, despite opposition. It said the review of services will mean a faster response and a better education for children with physical or learning disabilities. The Special Educational Needs Review began two-and-a-half years ago. But the government is only now bringing forward its plans, to change what is described as out-of-date legislation. Some of these have been altered in response to complaints from parents and disability groups. But the main proposal of replacing the \"statements\" remains. They can take a long time to achieve but can open the door to a lot of extra help for special needs pupils. Only 10% of the 3,000 responses approved of scrapping them. Nevertheless, in the new system, only pupils in special schools or with serious needs will get a new \"Co-ordinated Support Plan\" or CSP and schools will be expected to spot most problems and provide help for children. Pre-school education will spot problems early and 10 pilot schemes are working on that now. Education Minister John O'Dowd has revealed the consultation responses and said there was so much diversity in the replies, it would be impossible to please everyone. But he said he has listened to the views and re-examined the proposals. He is now expecting schools to raise their game and provide better support to children. Thirty-eight per cent of post primary schools were judged to fall short in their provision for special needs. In the future, the department plans to have only two stages on the way to getting the CSP replacement for a statement, which at the moment has five stages and is said to be too bureaucratic. The process will be speeded up with a time limit of 20 weeks, instead of 26 weeks. At present the statements must be reviewed every year, and that is said to be too bureaucratic and time consuming. In future, there would simply be a meeting between parent and school principal and a formal review only where one of them requests it. The Department of Education said the main aim is to change the mind-set among parents that only a \"statement\" of special needs can give adequate help to their children. Instead it wants to make sure that all children can be high achievers according to their ability and are helped to achieve the best results."

        "text": " Legal change inheritance 'threat' Children whose parents remarry and die without making a will could lose out on their inheritance after changes in Scots law, legal experts have warned. The amount a spouse is legally entitled to when their partner dies without a will has been raised by the Scottish government to 473,000. Ministers said the increase reflected inflation and updated existing law. But lawyers argue it means children from previous relationships are now unlikely to get any financial legacy. The level of entitlement for spouses whose partner's died without a will was originally 130,000, but it was raised to 300,000 in 2005. The new limit of 473,000 comes into effect from 1 February. Further allowances can bring the total entitlement up to 552,000, without children receiving anything. Inheritance solicitor Bruce de Wert said the move was a \"zombie law\" that threatened the financial position of thousands of families in Scotland at a time when second marriages were commonplace. \"Unless this is part of some 'big society' agenda by the current government to promote marriage over everything else, I think that we are sleepwalking into a situation which is unintended,\" he said. \"There has been no debate in the Scottish Parliament about this. The issue is not that the figure has been increased, it is that it is time to look at whether this law is appropriate in the 21st Century. \"Should the law favour married partners over children to such an extent? Most people would expect the law to arrange the natural flow of wealth down the generations. Is that an unreasonable expectation?\" The changes mean that a parent who remarries could eventually end up leaving all their assets to their new partner's children - rather than their own children from their first relationship - if they fail to make a will. The Scottish government has said the changes to the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964 meant fewer people in Scotland would be forced to sell their homes in future if their wife, husband or civil partner died without leaving a will. \"The increase in limits to 473,000 means that most people in Scotland will be able to stay in the family home they shared with their spouse or civil partner, sparing them the distress and disruption of leaving their homes at such a difficult time,\" Legal Affairs Minister Roseanna Cunningham said. A government spokesman added that the legislation had been scrutinised by both the subordinate legislation committee and the justice committee. A consultation also received responses from a number of legal experts, including the Law Society of Scotland. The death of a mountain rescue team leader during a search for a hillwalker 25 years ago is to be marked by his close friends and family."
