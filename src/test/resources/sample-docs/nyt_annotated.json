        "text": " Bats: Teixeira Sets His Sights on Small Ball After spending the 2011 season watching line drives get eaten up by infielders aligned toward right field, Mark Teixeira is finally ready to play some small ball. Teixeira was noticeably affected last year by the defensive shifts that sent three infielders to the right side of the field when he batted left-handed. He had been reluctant to change his pull-oriented approach \u2013 perhaps sending a few bunts down the third-base line \u2014 because he thought it would hurt his power and productivity. But Teixeira batted just.224 from the left side of the plate , and frustration finally took its toll. Teixeira said Tuesday night that he was eager to experiment with bunting once the Yankees convene for spring training in Tampa, Fla. He said he might attempt one bunt each game. \u201cI always mess around with it, but it\u2019s something you can\u2019t work on without live pitching,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cI may lay down 20 bunts this spring.\u201d Teixeira said the last time he recalled bunting was as a freshman in high school. He added that he beat the throw to first to notch a base hit. Teixeira, who was honored Tuesday night in Manhattan at the annual Thurman Munson Awards Dinner, which benefits the AHRC-New York City Foundation, said he had already made another important adjustment this off-season. He lost a considerable amount of weight, he said, by changing to a healthier diet. And he was was light-hearted when asked about the Yankees\u2019 competition this year. Teixeira joked that the pitching machines at Bobby Valentine\u2019s baseball academy in Stamford, Conn., where he trains in the off-season, began to malfunction after Valentine was named manager of the Boston Red Sox. Also noting the additions of first basemen Prince Fielder and Albert Pujols to the American League this winter, he said, \u201cIf I get one or two votes for the All-Star Game, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Tyler Kepner, David Waldstein, Andrew Keh and other contributors will bring baseball fans inside the 2012 baseball season with news and analysis of the Yankees, Mets and the rest of Major League Baseball. The Yankees slugger Mark Teixeira is looking for ways to beat the infield shift that stymied him last season. Kyle Williams, a receiver for the 49ers, faced criticism for mishandling two punt returns in the N.F.C. Championship game. His father Ken, the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, is not a fan favorite either. Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, speaks about the state of the game at the White Sox fan convention. With two natural first basemen on the roster, Manager Jim Leyland will have to put one of them at a suboptimal position. Which configuration would be the least inefficient?

        "text": " Russia Stands in the Way of U.N. Call for Assad to Step Down Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, prime minister of Qatar, seated at center, and Nabil al-Araby, left, secretary general of the Arab League, at the Security Council on Tuesday. UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The battle over Syria moved to the United Nations on Tuesday with Western powers and much of the Arab world confronting Russia and its allies in the Security Council over their refusal to condemn the Syrian government for its violent suppression of popular protests. As top diplomats gathered in the Council chamber for the showdown, the drumbeat of violence continued without pause in Syria, where government forces used heavy weapons and tanks to push rebels back from strongholds near Damascus. At the United Nations, the two sides skirmished over a draft Security Council resolution proposed by Morocco that calls for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power as the first step of a transition toward democracy. But behind all the arguments lurked the ghost of Libya, with Russia determined to block any resolution that might be construed as a license for regime change. The Arabs and top Western diplomats argued that endorsing the demonstrators was the minimum step required to support popular demands for change that began with peaceful demonstrations and have evolved into an increasingly armed uprising. \u201cThe Syrian government failed to make any serious effort to cooperate with us,\u201d Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, told the Security Council about Arab League efforts to mediate the dispute. \u201cThe government killing machine continues effectively unabated.\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined by the foreign ministers of Britain, France and several other countries, argued that Libya was a \u201cfalse analogy.\u201d The plan for a gradual democratic transition \u201crepresents the best efforts of Syria\u2019s neighbors to chart a way forward, and it deserves a chance to work,\u201d she said. The proposed resolution, which most likely would not be voted on before Friday, called for Mr. Assad to cede power to his vice president, who would help form a unity government that would prepare for elections. It is unlikely that Mr. Assad would heed the demands to step down, even if the resolution made it through the Council. But that remained a long shot Tuesday night. Fundamentally, the argument over Syria reflects a deeper divide between those who would use the Security Council to confront nations over how their governments treat civilians, versus those who consider that it has no role whatsoever in settling domestic disputes. Syria is the latest example in an argument that stretches back through all recent conflicts. Russia, backed discreetly by China and India, rejects the idea that the world organization can interfere in the domestic politics of any country to force a leadership change. They all feel that they were duped into supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, which was promoted as a means to protect civilians last March. Instead, they said, NATO used it as a license to help overthrow the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Churkin, adopted a \u201cwhere will it all end\u201d argument, telling reporters that the Security Council cannot prescribe ready recipes for the outcome of a domestic political process. \u201cOnce you start, it is difficult to stop,\u201d he said, adding that pretty soon the Council would start pronouncing \u201cwhat king needs to resign, or what prime minister needs to step down.\u201d To a certain extent, the Arab League and the much of the world were ready to dump the eccentric Colonel Qaddafi because he had made many enemies. Mr. Assad, despite hostile relations with some neighbors and the West, continues to have a strong ally in Russia, yet analysts described Moscow as preoccupied with leadership change. \u201cThat the Morocco resolution \u2018calls for\u2019 Assad to step aside is their worst example and fear,\u201d said George Lopez, a professor at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and a sometime adviser to the United Nations. \u201cIf today it is Assad, tomorrow Putin? They worry.\u201d Yet in a sign that Russia was beginning to feel the need to deflect at least some of the accusations that Moscow is partly responsible for not stemming the rising death toll, Russia distanced itself from Mr. Assad himself. The United Nations stopped tallying deaths after they passed 5,400 in January, saying they were too difficult to confirm accurately, and since then the toll has mounted steadily. Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Ellen Barry from Moscow. \u201cThe Russian policy is not about asking someone to step down; regime change is not our profession,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation during a stop on a tour of Asia. \u201cWe are not friends or allies of President Assad,\u201d he went on, according to a transcript on the Interfax news service. \u201cWe never said that Assad remaining in power is a precondition for regulating the situation. We said something else \u2014 we said that the decision should be made by Syrians, by the Syrians themselves.\u201d Mr. Lavrov made it clear that it was the example of Libya, where foreign powers intervened with force, that forged Russia\u2019s opposition. \u201cThe international community unfortunately did take sides in Libya and we would never allow the Security Council to authorize anything similar,\u201d he said. There is no Western nor Arab League support for the kind of international military intervention that occurred in Libya, because of concerns that an implosion of Syria could drag neighbors like Israel, Iraq and Lebanon into a wider conflagration. The goal is to try to stanch it without setting off a sectarian civil war. In the longest and most emotional speech of the day, Ambassador Bashar Jaafari of Syria evoked the famous Arab poet Nizar Qabbani and the long Arab struggle against colonialism to insult Qatar and others leading the effort to support political change in Syria, suggesting they were joining a Western plot. But Sheik Hamad and Nabil al-Araby, the Arab League secretary general, both pleaded with the Council that more international pressure was needed to meet the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people after 11 months of demonstrations. The league strategy \u2014 used as a blueprint for the resolution \u2014 mirrors that applied in Yemen, and promoted by Arab states, whereby the longtime autocratic president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, transferred power to his vice president after months of often bloody pro-democracy protests. Critics suggest that strategy aims merely to stop the violence without promoting real change. With Syria, other calculations also come into play. Vladimir V. Putin, who seeks to return to the Russian presidency in elections this March, wants to portray Russia as regaining its superpower influence. Russia\u2019s long ties to Syria generate billions of dollars in weapons sales, plus the relationship gives Moscow the entree it needs to the table for Middle East peace talks. In addition, the Russian Navy deploys some ships from the Syrian port of Tartous, widening Russia\u2019s sphere of influence into the Mediterranean. In the West, the interest in pressuring Mr. Assad to leave is partly rooted in the desire to weaken the position of Syria\u2019s ally, Iran, in the region, as well as that of Hezbollah, which continues to back the Damascus government. The haggling over the wording is expected to commence in earnest again on Wednesday. Russia and China vetoed a similar resolution last October. Diplomats have inserted all kinds of reassuring language into the paragraphs that touch on Russian sensitivities. \u201cNothing in this resolution compels states to resort to the use of force or the threat of force,\u201d it said, a point many foreign ministers echoed in their speeches, and it underscores the \u201cstrong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria, emphasizing the need to resolve the current crisis in Syria peacefully.\u201d It also calls on both the government and the rebels to halt the violence, although it does not equate the two sides as Russia often does. The official Syrian position is that it is under armed attack from terrorists from abroad. That explanation ignores the protest movements sweeping the region. Members of the Syrian National Council, a nascent government in exile, lobbied for the resolution, rejecting a Russian offer to sponsor talks in Moscow between the government and the opposition. Burhan Ghalioun, the president, said that even if the resolution passed, Mr. Assad would be likely to reject it."

        "text": " Music Review: Wagner&#x2019;s &#x2018;Rienzi&#x2019; From Opera Orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall Rienzi Onstage from left, Emily Duncan-Brown, Ian Storey and Eve Queler, conductor of the Opera Orchestra of New York, joined at Avery Fisher Hall by singers in the Vox Nova of the Special Music School. \u201cRienzi,\u201d Wagner\u2019s third opera , is seldom performed. Even the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, Germany, has yet to present it. There are many reasons. For one, it\u2019s long. At the opera\u2019s 1842 premiere in Dresden, the performance, including intermissions separating its five acts, ran more than six hours. Wagner later sanctioned many cuts to make the piece more doable. \u201cRienzi\u201d also poses epic challenges, including a big chorus, marches and processions. Musically, it is the young Wagner\u2019s attempt to do a German version of a French grand opera, and then some. The conductor Eve Queler has long been a champion of \u201cRienzi.\u201d In 1980, in the ninth season after founding the Opera Orchestra of New York , she conducted the work at Carnegie Hall. She revived it in 1982 and 1992. On Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall she conducted \u201cRienzi\u201d again with the orchestra, an effective concert performance with a good cast led by the British tenor Ian Storey. Ms. Queler stepped down as music director of the Opera Orchestra last year. The ensemble\u2019s 2011-12 season began in November with its new music director, Alberto Veronesi, conducting Cilea\u2019s \u201cAdriana Lecouvreur.\u201d Ms. Queler, who recently turned 76, walked a little gingerly, but conducted with confidence. The playing of the orchestra and the singing of the admirable New York Choral Society (directed by John Daly Goodwin) was sometimes tentative, understandably so, given the unfamiliarity and difficulties of the work. But under Ms. Queler the sweep, color and character of the opera came through vividly. The story, set in Rome in the mid-14th century, centers on Cola di Rienzi, a Roman tribune and populist who envisions a unified Italy. He becomes caught in the hostilities between two patrician families, the Orsinis and the Colonnas. When Rienzi leads forces that defeat the nobles, the people rally to his cause. But he is a classic flawed hero whose good intentions spin out of control. By the end the nobles, the church and even the people have turned against him. Wagner may have had the French grand operas of Meyerbeer in mind when he wrote \u201cRienzi,\u201d but the score exudes Italianate style. Whole stretches of ornate melodic lines inspired by bel canto soar over repetitive accompanimental patterns in the orchestra. Yet the music also has Romantic flourishes and symphonic majesty. There are hints of \u201cTannh\u00e4user,\u201d \u201cLohengrin\u201d and more. Mr. Storey, who had the gravity and vocal heft for the daunting title role, sang with stamina and intelligence. Sometimes his sound was grainy, and his sustained tones wobbled. But you could only be grateful to this veteran Wagnerian for learning for this concert a role that he will have few other chances to sing. As Irene, the soprano Elisabete Matos brought a steely sheen and impressive power to her singing. The mezzo-soprano G\u00e9raldine Chauvet won an enormous ovation for her performance in the pants role of Adriano Colonna, who is in love with Irene. Ms. Chauvet\u2019s rich, dark voice turned patchy in a few exposed flights. But this was singing of throbbing expressivity and style. The cast was winning over all, especially the baritone Ricardo Rivera as Orsini, and the bass-baritone Brandon Cedel as Raimondo, the papal legate. Some young artists made strong contributions in smaller roles, including Philip Horst, Jonathan Winell, Shannon DeVine and, as the Messenger of Peace, the sweet-toned Emily Duncan-Brown. Ms. Queler fared pretty well at the traffic-cop demands of conducting \u201cRienzi,\u201d which included battalions of brasses in the balconies, the West Point Cadet Glee Club during a soldiers\u2019 chorus (talk about typecasting), and the endearing children from Vox Nova of the Special Music School, who marched down the aisles in white robes, singing an angelic chorus beautifully. The Opera Orchestra of New York will perform Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra,\u201d with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in the title role and Alberto Veronesi conducting, on March 7 at Avery Fisher Hall; (212) 906-9137, operaorchestrany.org.

        "text": " Daily Stock Market Activity Wall Street closed a strong month narrowly mixed on Tuesday as weaker-than-expected economic reports surprised investors after a stream of positive data in recent months. Still, stocks rallied sharply in January, partly on hopes the American economy will dodge the effects of a recession in Europe. But those hopes were dented Tuesday, with home prices in the United States and business activity in the Midwest missing expectations. Consumer confidence also dropped. The market was sharply lower in the late morning, but erased much of that loss, repeating a pattern in recent trade that has been seen as a sign of resilience. \u201cOnce you start to get some negative numbers, especially around the consumer, it lends to the argument that G.D.P. growth is not really there and it is going to go back to zero,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to 12,632.91. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.60 point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,312.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,813.84. Earnings reports continued to paint a muddled picture. Exxon Mobil fell 2 percent to $83.74 and was the biggest drag on both the Dow and S.& P. 500 Exxon\u2019s profit narrowly beat expectations as rising oil prices offset falling margins on chemicals and fuel, and production fell short of some estimates. Robert Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC Capital in New York, said depressed interest rates and a stalling of gains in industrial copper are pointing to a short-term reversal in economically sensitive sectors, like materials and banks, that have led the rally. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 204 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported results so far, 59.8 percent topped estimates, tracking below the beat rate at this stage of the earnings season in recent quarters. Hopes that Greece would reach a deal with private creditors on a debt swap and receive a bailout to sidestep a chaotic default raised market sentiment initially. Investors again flocked to the safety of United States securites. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 to 101 27/32. The yield fell to 1.80 percent, from 1.85 percent late Monday. Shortly after the opening bell, the S.& P. 500 piereced a bullish technical level, known as a golden cross, as its 50-day average ticked above its 200-day average. The signal indicates a shift in momentum and usually means gains in the index within six months. In 26 golden crosses since 1962, the S.& P. 500 gained an average 4.1 percent over the next three months and was positive 73 percent of the time. In the next six months it gained 6.6 percent and was positive 81 percent of the time, according to Birinyi Associates. In January, the S.& P. 500 gained 4.4 percent, its best month since October. The Dow rose 3.4 percent for its fourth straight month of gains, while the Nasdaq advanced 8 percent. Results from Pfizer and Eli Lilly both topped expectations. But Pfizer trimmed its 2012 outlook and Lilly repeated its forecast for a drop in 2012 earnings. Lilly rose 1.2 percent, to $39.74 and Pfizer dipped 0.8 percent, to $21.40. Transportation stocks dipped as United Parcel Service gave up early gains to fall 0.7 percent, to $75.65. The package delivery group posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit , but analysts cited profit-taking and company comments on euro headwinds in the first quarter. Housing stocks fell after the S.& P./Case Shiller report on home prices. The Dow home construction index declined 1.7 percent. Lennar, a home builder, lost 2.9 percent, to $21.49."

        "text": " Square Feet: In Philadelphia&#x2019;s Market East, Sign Law Spurs Investment The Gallery at Market East in central Philadelphia will lease part of its third floor to the Philadelphia Media Network. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 An influx of new residents, stores, restaurants and hotels in Center City has largely bypassed Market East, the blocks of Market Street east of City Hall to Independence Mall. The Philadelphia Media Network will take the third floor of the former Strawbridge & Clothier department store. Plans for the area have included shiny glass retail pavilions, multiplex movie theaters and a Disney indoor amusement park, all of which foundered for various reasons. Still, over the last few months, the district\u2019s fortunes have brightened, prompted in part by the imminent arrival of a large new office tenant. The tenant is Philadelphia Media Network , which publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News, as well as a Web portal, philly.com. It recently signed a lease for 125,000 square feet that will straddle the third floor of the old Strawbridge & Clothier department store building on Market Street and part of the third floor of the adjoining Gallery at Market East , a fortresslike, 1.1-million-square-foot indoor shopping mall that opened in 1977. The mall has three anchor stores, but it has struggled to attract tenants for the upper floors and is only 62 percent occupied. Philadelphia Media Network will be the first business to take advantage of a sign ordinance that Philadelphia passed last summer to help create a digital district in the Market East section. It allows developers, in exchange for an investment of at least $10 million, to put up and collect revenue from large digital signs and billboards on the outside of Market Street buildings between Seventh and 13th Streets. Philadelphia Media Network will have two digital signs on Market Street and two on Ninth Street, and each sign will be about 14 feet wide and 45 feet long, said Joseph F. Coradino, the president of Preit Services and Preit-Rubin, the commercial development and management subsidiaries of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust , the company that owns both the Gallery and the old Strawbridge site. The sign ordinance has limits. For example, it will allow digital signs to appear only on properties that have 100 feet or more of frontage on Market Street. \u201cThis is not Times Square, where the goal is to basically cover buildings with signs,\u201d said Paul R. Levy, the president of the Center City District , a business improvement group and an early supporter of the ordinance. \u201cOur goal here was to integrate the signs into the existing architecture.\u201d Still, for Philadelphia Media Network, the prospect of new digital signage \u201cadded to the attraction\u201d of coming to the area, said Michael Kuritzkes, the general counsel for the company, which came out of bankruptcy in October 2010. He said plans now called for the company to move from the historic, 525,000-square-foot Inquirer building on North Broad Street, where offices are spread out among more than 10 floors, to the space on Market Street, where \u201ceveryone will see everyone else in a very collaborative way.\u201d The Inquirer building was sold last fall to the developer Bart Blatstein. \u201cFor a very historic, traditional newspaper company to make a change in culture, this is a terrific place to be,\u201d he said. At the Gallery a long-anticipated overhaul has yet to get under way, although city officials say Preit has presented a plan to make the mall livelier and the stores more accessible to shoppers on the street. To attract new retailers, the company hopes first to woo both fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants to a property that now has only two food courts. \u201cWe think food should be the real focus first,\u201d Mr. Coradino said. Alan Greenberger, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development, said city officials were working with Preit to simplify the mall\u2019s complicated ownership so that it can more readily attract private financing. \u201cThe trigger event for Market East will be the redo of the Gallery,\u201d he said. One developer that already has a large stake in the Market East neighborhood is SSH Real Estate , a commercial real estate company based in the city. In 2008, it helped form a partnership that eventually acquired Girard Square, a set of four buildings that straddle a full city block across the street from the Gallery. At SSH, plans have long called for building a high-rise that would sit on the site of one of the buildings at Girard Square, and in December the company, along with its partners, teamed with National Real Estate Advisors , a large equity investor based in Washington, to help it reach its goal. Jeffrey J. Kanne, the president and chief executive of National Real Estate Advisors, said that building would include a fitness club, a 200- to 300-unit residential tower and a 250-room hotel, in addition to retail spaces. Despite a recent boom in residential and hotel development, new restaurant rows and a recent expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, Center City\u2019s retail market remains spotty. While some streets, like Walnut and Chestnut, are continuing to draw both national and international retailers, the consensus is that the area could use more midprice retailers, like a long-hoped-for Target store in Market East, where retail spaces of more than 25,000 square feet are still relatively easy to find. One new tenant on Market Street is TJX Companies, the retailer based in Framingham, Mass., that operates stores under both the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls names. It signed a lease in December for 26,000 square feet of space on the corner of 11th and Market Street, for what may possibly be a new Marshalls store, said Michael J. Katz, the leasing agent for the Jenel Management Corporation, the New York-based real estate company that owns the site. The site is now occupied by a Staples store, and it sits on a modest stretch of Market Street that includes drugstores, cellphone shops and a two-acre street parking lot that was once promoted as a site for the Disney amusement park. \u201cThe signage will show retailers that the area is changing,\u201d Peter C. Soens, a partner at SSH Real Estate, said of the new ordinance. \u201cThere is very strong interest from retailers that they want to be in Center City, and Market East is now the only part of Center City where you can get a large footprint.\u201d"

        "text": " Anthony Bevilacqua, Ex-Head of Philadelphia Archdiocese, Dies at 88 PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, died Tuesday night at his suburban residence, a spokeswoman said. He was 88. Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna Farrell said Bevilacqua died in his sleep at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003. Bevilacqua, trained in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in the upcoming trial of a longtime aide. Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities. In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an \"aberration, a moral evil\" and suggested gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be an active homosexual \u2014 a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare. He was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call for a \"New Evangelization,\" Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests. \"We are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out to people like never before,\" Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began in 1998. At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students. Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his late 70s. \"I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions,\" he said at age 77. \"My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic.\" He made a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights and run several miles on a treadmill at home. \"Come 8 o'clock, my day is not my own,\" he said. But he settled into retirement after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Prosecutors said last year that not much had changed since the first investigation, when the \"abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself.\" Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took orders from Bevilacqua. Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004. \"With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups,\" said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants. He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y. He earned a doctoral degree in canon law from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court. In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh."

        "text": " Sony Elevates Kazuo Hirai to President and C.E.O. TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp named Vice President Kazuo Hirai as president and CEO, replacing Howard Stringer who will step down from day-to-day management in a long-expected change for a company struggling to regain its driving force in consumer electronics. Stringer will remain chairman of the company until June, when he will become chairman of the board of directors, a separate post that will not be directly involved in company management, Sony spokeswoman Mami Imada said. The are no plans to replace him in the chairman's role, she added. Sony announced the changes ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, which is expected to forecast the company will post a net loss for the fourth year in a row as its TV division bleeds red ink. Hirai will take over on April 1. The last year has been brutal for many Japanese companies, hit by a strong yen that hurt exports, and two natural disasters -- the March earthquake in Japan and record floods in Thailand. But Sony has also come under fire for losing the innovative edge behind products like the Walkman and the Playstation, and ceding ground to rivals such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics as consumers snapped up their iPhones, iPods and Galaxy gadgets. The urbane and English-speaking Hirai, 51, will have to plot a course to revitalize the electronics giant as consumers lose interest in its products and gravitate instead towards smartphones and tablet PCs from other brand names. Sony's shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since Welsh-born Stringer, who turns 70 later this month, took the helm as CEO in 2005. In contrast, Apple shares have galloped ahead more than 1,000 percent, while Samsung, a maker of smartphones, flat panels and computer chips, is up more than 100 percent over the same period. ANOINTED SUCCESSOR Hirai was effectively anointed as Stringer's successor last March when he was promoted to head Sony's consumer products and services businesses, which produce the bulk of Sony's $85 billion in annual sales. He made his name in the PlayStation video games division, once a key profit driver for Sony that fell into the red for four consecutive years until he took the reins and pulled it back into the black two years ago. \"The path we must take is clear,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday. \"To drive the growth of our core electronics businesses -- primarily digital imaging, smart mobile and games; to turn around the television business; and to accelerate the innovation that enables us to create new business domains.\" Stringer, a former journalist who later ran U.S. broadcaster CBS, was brought in as a rare foreign CEO at a top Japanese company to shake things up and restore its innovative edge in consumer electronics. Many analysts though see his major achievement as cost cutting. Stringer's restructuring efforts included selling off TV factories in Spain, Slovakia and Mexico and outsourcing more than half of its production to other companies, including Hon Hai Precision Industry, the contract electronics maker that also counts Apple as its key customer. In recent months, Sony exited an LCD panel joint venture with Samsung, which will allow it to procure screens for its TVs more cheaply. It also agreed to buy out Ericsson's half of their smartphone venture for $1.5 billion to shore up its position in a market where Apple and Samsung have become leaders. Sony's share of the flat-panel television market has been eroded by the rise of Samsung and a host of nimbler Asian players, while a hacking scandal last year undermined confidence in its management. Many of Japan's other electronics titans have also stumbled in recent years. In the current reporting season, Nintendo and Sharp Corp both issued bigger-than-expected loss projections for the full year. South Korean rivals such as Samsung have been particularly aggressive in investment and blessed with favorable currency movements, while Apple has stolen much of the innovative thunder that once emanated from Japan. Sony reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday, when it is also due to brief the media on the management reshuffle. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S gave a consensus forecast of just 8.8 billion yen ($115.41 million) in operating profit for the key October-December quarter, when consumers spend heavily on gadgets for year-end gift-giving, and 8.2 billion yen for the full financial year to March.

        "text": " In January, a Rare Calm Fell on the Markets A trader monitoring prices at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Some analysts said the market was poised for a pullback. Living up to its reputation, January was a relatively stable month on Wall Street. Volatility eased as investors appeared to take in stride the latest developments in the European debt crisis and persistent worries about economic growth. At the same time, stocks motored through the month with slow but steady advances, logging in their biggest January gain since 1997. Amid the calm, some analysts said there were signs that the market was poised for a pullback with choppy trading in the coming weeks. One of the main gauges of market uncertainty, the so-called fear index, or VIX, settled at a reading of 19.44 on Tuesday after hovering at 18 last week, well below the average of 24 for the index in 2011. When the index fell below 20 on Jan. 19, it was the first time that it had dipped below that level since July. \u201cNobody expected this period to be quite that dead,\u201d Jamie Tyrrell, a VIX index trader, said. Also absent were the gyrations that characterized price swings in stocks in the second half of 2011. The broadest gauge of the stock market, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, budged more than 1 percent only on two trading days in January, and they were increases both times. That makes it the quietest January since 2007, when the S.& P. moved at least 1 percent on just one day. \u201cThe market definitely is holding its own, even though we start out poorly during the day,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst for S.& P. indices. The so-called January Barometer, created by Yale Hirsch of the Stock Traders Almanac \u2014 who coined the saying, \u201cAs January goes, so goes the year\u201d \u2014 shows that of the 38 years since 1950 when the S.& P. has gone up in January, it has finished the year higher for 34 of those years. The index finished up 4.4 percent for the month, even after falling for a fourth consecutive day on Tuesday to 1,312.41, or down by 0.05 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.4 percent in January, closing on Tuesday at 12,632.91. The Nasdaq was up 8 percent for the month, after a slight 0.7 percent rise on Tuesday. Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab, wrote in a market note that a palette of \u201ctechnical, sentiment and simply fun\u201d indicators, like the \u201cgolden cross\u201d of moving averages, the Yale Crash Confidence Index and the Ned Davis Research Crowd Sentiment Poll, could show the market is vulnerable to a pullback in the near term, but it will likely remain a bull market with further gains. Although concerns over Europe, bank and market liquidity, and the economy are still in play, traders said there was a sense that the crisis in Europe was being addressed. The European Central Bank has infused banks with hundreds of billions in funding, and spiking Italian bond yields have settled. \u201cRisky assets in general have shown less volatility in January as the rally thus far has been steady, consistent and measured,\u201d said Otis C. Casey III, the director for credit research at Markit. When talks between Greece and its private sector creditors over restructuring its debt hit a snag more than a week ago, the broader stock market held above 1,300. It stayed about that mark at the end of trading on Monday, despite a temporary 1 percent slip early as observers tried to make sense of the latest summit of European leaders. Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said she started to notice volatility easing in late 2011, after the Federal Reserve and European central banks took steps to ease financing conditions for European banks. \u201cThere was a sense that central banks globally were monitoring the situation,\u201d she said. But she added: \u201cSentiment levels have risen, the market is overbought, and the VIX is coming down. Those all add up to the seasonality that we are going to face in February. We are expecting a pullback in equity indexes.\u201d The calm follows a volatile year. In 2011, the debt crisis in Europe stirred fears of sovereign defaults and concerns that financial contagion could spread to the United States. A downgrade of the United States\u2019 credit rating for the first time also hit the markets, as did concerns over slow growth and Washington\u2019s debt-ceiling stalemate. On 35 trading days in 2011, the S.& P. 500 closed with a gain or loss of 2 percent or more \u2014 the most number of days of that magnitude since the financial crisis of 2008-9. The VIX spiked to levels not seen since March 2009, hitting a high of 48 on Aug. 8, 2011. There are still the prospects for volatility to return, analysts caution, because of persistent worries that a wave of sovereign and banking defaults will swamp the euro zone. As an indicator of future volatility, the VIX, officially known as the CBOE Volatility Index, is showing that investors are already pricing in their expectations that the index will rise. Despite its Tuesday level of just over 19, futures contracts are betting on the VIX being at 26 in June and 27 in July, which would mean corresponding daily swings of about 1.5 percent on average on the S.& P., Mr. Tyrrell said. Mr. Tyrrell said he did not attribute the predicted rise in the VIX to specific events, but it was more because investors believed the index could not go any lower. \u201cInvestors are wary of predicting that the market is going to be totally calm,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last few years, we have seen so many instances where it is not. They are pricing in that risk of a major market pullback.\u201d"

        "text": " In Crown Heights, a Renaissance With Unease Franklin Avenue, once peppered with drug dealers and run-down properties, is the center of a renaissance in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. Young Brooklynites gather on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, often waiting an hour on weekends to get into Barboncino, a stylish and spacious four-month-old pizza restaurant named for a toy poodle. In 1991, the police tried to quell violence between Hasidic Jewish and black residents. The riots stigmatized Crown Heights. But up the block at JamRock Kitchen, a narrow Jamaican take-out place catering to the neighborhood\u2019s dwindling Caribbean population, business has been sporadic since it opened four years ago. These are two divergent snapshots of a remarkably refashioned commercial strip that 20 years ago was marred by drug dealers and dilapidated storefronts in a neighborhood torn apart by racial and religious violence. Now Franklin Avenue is the epicenter of a renaissance, the next subway stop on Brooklyn\u2019s gentrification express. But unlike the transformation in Park Slope or Williamsburg, this story is different \u2014 and far more complicated \u2014 because it is set on scarred earth. The riots that exploded between blacks and Hasidic Jews in August 1991 stigmatized Crown Heights as violent and intolerant. It has taken two decades for the tensions to ease, and now the neighborhood is absorbing a new jolt to its still-fragile dynamic: the influx of mostly white artists, young professionals, families and entrepreneurs seeking affordability. Beneath the pulsing energy on and around Franklin Avenue, there is an undercurrent of unease, suspicion and resentment from some longtime residents, a legacy of the riots. \u201cThere\u2019s not a hostility amongst these groups, but, being an old timer, I don\u2019t see that warmth and neighborliness kicking in yet because folks are still strangers,\u201d said John Flateau, 62, a Crown Heights native and chairman of the department of public administration at Medgar Evers College. \u201cThere\u2019s a social cohesion gap right now.\u201d One Hasidic landlord posted a complaint on a local news Web site about the immodesty of the new \u201cyuppies,\u201d rallying his neighbors to take back Crown Heights. Some wary African-American and West Indian residents, including those who complain of being priced out of the area, expressed fears that the demographic change would force people who have endured the neighborhood\u2019s worst moments to move. For years, Crown Heights has been a diverse and divided community with West Indians, Caribbeans and African-Americans concentrated in the northern part and Hasidic Jewish groups in the southern part. But the white population in the area around Franklin Avenue has increased 15 percent in the last 10 years, according to the 2010 census. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood increased 36 percent in 2011, according to a rental market report by a brokerage firm, and two-bedroom apartments renovated with luxury touches now start at around $1,800 per month, a local real estate agent said. Three new apartment buildings are either fully rented or sold. A one-family town house just off Franklin Avenue was listed at nearly $1.1 million recently, a sum that no one could have begged for, let alone asked, two decades ago. With a heavier police presence along Franklin Avenue, crime has dropped significantly in the past decade, but is still an issue, and some black business owners say they have been harassed by the police. And, some of those owners said, the influx of newcomers has not translated into more customers. \u201cI thought I would be doing a lot better being so close to the subway, but new people rotate in and out of the neighborhood,\u201d said Conrad Hunter, 36, the owner of JamRock Kitchen. Many of his target customers \u2014 West Indian and Caribbean residents \u2014 are leaving the neighborhood. \u201cYou\u2019re just floating to keep your head over water,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it bringing new revenue? It\u2019s not.\u201d A corner grocery at Lincoln Place and Franklin where Ms. Williams shops, Bob and Betty\u2019s, is now selling organic food , mostly to young newcomers, and giving away cardboard boxes to older residents moving out. Tony Fisher, who took over the store his father, Bob, opened 31 years ago, remembers when holdups on the block were routine. While thrilled with the change, he is also a bit resentful. \u201cI look at all these newcomers and these new businesses on Franklin Avenue and I think they are jumping on a bandwagon,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. \u201cWhere were they 25 years ago?\u201d Linda McKenzie, 50, took advantage of the new climate to open the thriving Veggies Natural Juice Bar, persuaded by a relative living in Crown Heights that Franklin Avenue was changing. \u201cBut I did not expect it to go in this direction so quickly,\u201d Ms. McKenzie said. The juice bar attracts a mix of old-time Jamaican residents and newcomers. Evangeline Porter, 79, who founded the Crow Hill Community Association 25 years ago, remembers chasing drug dealers off Franklin. Her group planted trees on the block 10 years ago, and they are finally blooming. \u201cFranklin Avenue is my baby,\u201d said Ms. Porter, who recounted a recent conversation with one landlord. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019re letting these people come in and take over.\u2019 I told him, \u2018I am.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Porter, who is black, criticized African-American merchants for being complacent in rebuilding the neighborhood years ago and praised many of the \u201cyoung Caucasians\u201d for attending community meetings. \u201cThey saw the potential of the neighborhood and said, \u2018What can we do to help?\u2019 \u201d she said. Kevin Phillip, 40, grew up in Crown Heights and started a T-shirt business 13 years ago. Now with his wife, Garnett, he owns the Candy Rush, an ice cream and candy store on Franklin Avenue, and is bullish about the avenue\u2019s future. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really thinks about what happened here,\u201d he said, referring to the riots. \u201cIt\u2019s more what\u2019s happening here.\u201d The riots erupted when a driver from a Hasidic official\u2019s motorcade struck and killed a 7-year-old black boy, which prompted black residents to take to the streets, some calling for revenge. A 29-year-old Hasidic scholar visiting from Australia was attacked and fatally stabbed. Richard Green, who founded the Crown Heights Youth Coalition in the mid-1980s, said the racial violence occurred in part because blacks and Jews had kept to themselves. \u201cWe were never really formally introduced to each other,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good lesson as we see new groups coming in.\u201d Despite the transformation of the northern part of Crown Heights into a vibrant neighborhood filled with handsome 19th-century brownstones, the recent past is hard to shake. Real estate brokers last spring tried to rebrand the neighborhood ProCro, a hybrid of the names Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the area, saw it as an unvarnished attempt to increase the neighborhood\u2019s appeal by blurring its name. \u201cI was offended,\u201d said Mr. Jeffries, who grew up in Crown Heights. \u201cThe collective efforts of the black and Jewish neighbors are what made Crown Heights the destination and the attractive neighborhood it is today.\u201d"

        "text": " City Braced to Ride Out Storm as Tevez Stays MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - The transfer window has slammed shut on Manchester City's hopes of selling outcast Carlos Tevez this season, leaving them with a gifted striker who has probably burned too many bridges to be of any use to their Premier League title push. Should Tevez return from self-imposed exile in Argentina and join his team mates for training, City face the prospect of having to resume paying high wages for a player who manager Roberto Mancini has said has no future at the club. The league leaders had stopped his salary since he left for his homeland without their permission in November and imposed a fine of six weeks' pay on him for gross misconduct - a punishment he is appealing to the Premier League over. Legal experts say City could probably find a way to terminate his contract if he continued to not turn up for work but the club would then lose out on a transfer fee as the player would be a free agent. The high-risk option would be to release him and sue him for the loss of a transfer fee that local media estimate at 25-30 million pounds but there would be no guarantees for City that Tevez would be able to pay it. \"They are effectively at a stage of brinkmanship - there is not a lot that City can do other than ride out the storm,\" Matt Taylor, an associate at international law firm Eversheds, told Reuters. \"They can't do what you would ordinarily do in this situation and terminate the contract. \"If Manchester City wanted to be very aggressive and put down a marker for the whole of football to say that players aren't allowed to ride roughshod over clubs, they could consider terminating his contract for non-performance on Tevez's part and sue him for their losses. \"That would really take the wind out of his sails because then he would be facing a legal suit for 30 million pounds. \"But that's not very attractive for Manchester City because they have then got to go after an individual for the money... There would be all sorts of difficulties with tying him down to a particular legal jurisdiction and enforcing any judgment that goes against him.\" There is a precedent for a club suing a former player for compensation with Chelsea having pursued Adrian Mutu after sacking him when he tested positive for cocaine in 2004. City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak last week issued a strongly worded statement saying the club would hold Tevez to his contract if no buyer was found in the January window. That could mean further fines if Tevez continues to breach his contract by staying away or if he does return he will be expected to resume training. Even if he does start attending the Carrington training sessions, his chances of ever playing a match for the club he once captained look slim. DOOR SHUT Mancini said Tevez was \"finished\" after refusing to warm up in a Champions League game at Bayern Munich in September and while he later held out an olive branch, he has since shut the door on a return. But that was before Mancini's optimism of an imminent sale was wiped out as interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain came to nothing. The Italian, who said this week there were no personal problems between him and Tevez, could possibly do with a striker as the Argentine's absence has left him with only three to choose from and Mario Balotelli is serving a four-match ban. Mancini has been visibly tired of fielding Tevez-related questions at news conferences and while the matter does not appear to have affected their form, the team could do without the distractions as the title race heats up. City's 1-0 loss at Everton on Tuesday has allowed Manchester United to draw level on points with their neighbours at the top as City's free-scoring ways have dried up a little of late. Whether last season's joint top scorer in the league comes back to help City in their bid for a first league title since 1968 remains to be seen, but he could be happy just picking up a widely reported 200,000 pounds per week for merely training. It could also be in his interest to rejoin his team mates to work on his fitness before the next transfer window when he is once again likely to be the subject of much speculation."

Afterward, coach Roy Williams said Barnes would get a few days off to rest. The Demon Deacons (11-11, 2-6) struggled just as badly as the Tar Heels with their shooting. Wake Forest shot just 30 percent, including 2 for 18 from 3-point range. The game closed a three-game week for the Tar Heels, who beat rival North Carolina State last Thursday then defeated Georgia Tech on Sunday. North Carolina doesn't play again until traveling to Maryland on Saturday, then returns home to face No. 7 Duke next week in the latest renewal of that fierce rivalry. The Tar Heels shot the ball well in the past two wins and hit 10 3-pointers against the Yellow Jackets, but they didn't bring that with them to Winston-Salem. In a sign of what was to come, North Carolina's first three field goals were all second-chance baskets off its own misses, while the Tar Heels shot just 4 for 19 from 3-point range. No North Carolina player shot even 50 percent, while perimeter threats Barnes, Bullock and P.J. Hairston combined to shoot 6 for 26 from the field and miss 11 of 13 3-point tries. Yet the Demon Deacons were in no position to take advantage. They had lost five of six, with the past four losses all coming by at least 11 points. And the Demon Deacons were greeted by plenty of empty green seats and a large splattering of Carolina blue from the stands in their own building for this one. Still, Wake Forest trailed by 12 at halftime and was within 40-34 with about 14 minutes left against the cold-shooting Tar Heels. But Kendall Marshall knocked down a 3-pointer to start the clinching run, then Bullock added his only 3 before Zeller tipped in a miss from Marshall to cap the 12-0 run and give UNC a 60-38 lead with 6:11 left."

        "text": " MF Global Risk Chief Once Saw Euro Bets as 'Acceptable' January 31, 2012, 9:34 pm Legal/Regulatory MF Global Risk Chief Once Saw Euro Bets as \u2018Acceptable\u2019 Tina Fineberg for The New York Times MF Global\u2019s chief risk officer is set to tell Congress on Thursday that he did not sound the alarms about the firm\u2019s risky wagers on European sovereign debt until July, about three months before the firm collapsed into bankruptcy. Michael Stockman joined MF Global after Michael Roseman, the firm\u2019s previous risk chief, clashed with the firm\u2019s top executives about the European debt positions. Mr. Roseman argued that the bets could sour and wanted Jon S. Corzine , the firm\u2019s chief executive and the architect of the bond plan, to seek approval from the board if he wanted to expand the bets. The board sided with Mr. Corzine. And when Mr. Stockman took over in early 2011, he did not immediately adopt his predecessor\u2019s skepticism. Michael Stockman's prepared testimony \u201cFor the first several months of my tenure, based on analyses performed by my department, I believed that the risk profile associated with the company\u2019s European sovereign debt position was acceptable in light of then-prevailing market conditions,\u201d Mr. Stockman said in prepared testimony to be delivered before a House panel on Thursday. He added that his risk department team \u201cregularly analyzed\u201d the company\u2019s positions. MF Global collapsed on Oct. 31 amid a crisis of confidence after it was publicly revealed that regulators were growing concerned that Mr. Corzine had placed a big bet on European sovereign bonds. Mr. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, had wagered that the European Union would not let nations like Ireland and Portugal default. Mr. Stockman is prepared to say that he did not raise concerns about the bet until July. \u201cAs credit markets deteriorated in the summer of 2011, I came to the view that it would be prudent for the company to mitigate the increased risks associated with its European sovereign debt trading position, and to consider entering into hedging transactions to reduce the company\u2019s exposure,\u201d he said in the testimony. He conveyed his concerns to \u201csenior management\u201d and explored ways to wind down the risk, Mr. Stockman said in the prepared remarks. In August, he then outlined his concerns in presentations to MF Global\u2019s board. \u201cIn my view, the board and senior management were highly sophisticated; they knew and understood how the\u201d positions worked, he said, adding that \u201cthey were well aware of the increased risks caused by weakening market conditions.\u201d The board finally heeded the warnings. In his testimony, Mr. Stockman said the board ceased adding to the debt purchases. But it was too late. Regulators were already breathing down on the firm, and within two months, it would be in bankruptcy. Mr. Stockman is to testify on Thursday before the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee, which will hold the fourth Congressional hearing on MF Global\u2019s downfall. The committee is to hear from both Mr. Stockman and Mr. Roseman, offering the first opportunity for the risk officers to explain their oversight on the European bond positions. The committee is also to hear from executives at rating agencies that were slow to respond to MF Global\u2019s swift downfall. Mr. Stockman is not expected to shed any light on another question swirling around MF Global: what happened to $1.2 billion in customer money that vanished when the firm collapsed? \u201cI have no personal knowledge of any missing funds or unreconciled customer accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cLike everyone else, I am very hopeful that all missing customer funds will be located and promptly returned to the rightful owners.\u201d Bankruptcy , european sovereign debt crisis , House Financial Services Committee , Jon S.

        "text": " Giants D-Line a Key vs Brady in Super Bowl INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Giants defense will do everything it can to pressure Tom Brady, and the way the front four has been playing lately it's more a matter of what happens when the pass rush closes in on the Patriots quarterback. \"I think it starts with hitting him, even when you don't actually get sacks, just keeping people around him so he can't step up,\" defensive end Justin Tuck said Tuesday at media day. \"I think he gets a little frustrated when he has to go to his second or third receivers. You can kind of confuse him sometimes with our coverage. I think there are a lot of things that can get him rattled, but it just seems like not too many people are able to do that.\" The Giants have the people to make it happen in Sunday's Super Bowl. In beating the Patriots four years ago in the NFL title game, the Giants sacked Brady five times, hit him nine other times and forced a fumble in their 17-14 upset. In turning around their season with a five-game winning streak to make it to Indianapolis, the Giants (12-7) have allowed a total of 67 points, 13.4 per game, and produced 20 sacks with no opposing quarterback throwing for more than 251 yards \u2014 including Aaron Rodgers of the Packers. \"To be honest, I think our confidence is very high,\" said second-year defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, who led the Giants with 16 sacks in the regular season. \"We know what we have to do and what's at stake. This is our last game, and we're in the Super Bowl. We have to go out and give it our all.\" In their 24-20 win over the Patriots in early November, the Giants sacked Brady twice and had two interceptions. One sack led to a fumble recovery that set up a score. \"We did some things that disrupted his timing,\" defensive coordinator Perry Fewell said. \"We caused him to stay jittery in the pocket. Hopefully we can do that again.\" A lot of changed since that game. Tuck was playing hurt at the time. Osi Umenyiora was still not healthy after missing the start of the season with a knee injury and the defense was still giving up too many big plays. Now, everyone on the defense is healthy. The secondary is covering receivers and the line has finally meshed and is playing its best. Umenyiora has no doubt the Giants will get to Brady. \"They're going to definitely do some things to keep us off of him, max protections, short throws, quick throws, but they can only do that for so long,\" Umenyiora said. \"Whenever we have opportunities where he does hold the ball, we're going to have to get to the quarterback.\" Center Dan Connolly said the Patriots need to keep Brady upright. \"Keeping him from being hit is our No. 1 goal,\" Connolly said. \"If he can stand back there and do his job, we'll be OK.\" Seven-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman and current NFL Network analyst Warren Sapp says the Patriots better establish a running game if Brady is to be successful. \"There is no way they can drop Tom Brady back 40 times and expose him to this rush,\" Sapp said. \"Whoever controls the line of scrimmage wins this ballgame. It's always that simple. If New England can get a run game going, we have a ballgame, If they expose him to the rush when it's third-and-6, third-and-7 and third-and-8, look out. You can't let a defensive lineman pin your ears back.\" And once the Giants' line starts getting to the quarterback, it's contagious. \"You know, the adrenaline is pumping,\" Pierre-Paul said. \"You just have to get there, and like a dunk, you've just got to dunk the ball. Once you do it, you just want another one. Like a sack, once you get one sack, you just want more. The guys on my front line, if Osi gets a sack, I want two sacks, because if I get two sacks, Justin Tuck is going to want three sacks.\" That's what happened in 2008 when a few of the names were different, with the obvious absence being Michael Strahan. \"This game will not be won off what we did in '07 or what we did earlier this year,\" Tuck said. \"I hope we don't fall into that trap of believing that because that team has won 10 straight. They are playing, I think, better football \u2014 team football \u2014 than they played in '07. But, I think we are playing better team football than we played in '07. It's going to be a fun matchup. It's going to be a fun atmosphere, and I am looking forward to it.\""

Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. Republican and Democratic presidents are quite different in their enforcement of tax laws and their administration of the Internal Revenue Service. Republicans are constantly telling us how different they are from the Democrats, and vice versa. But in many ways Republican and Democratic politicians are a lot like Coke and Pepsi \u2013 very different marketing but essentially made of the same chemicals. President Obama, for example, has retained the Republican policy of keeping prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. And as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney put into place a state health insurance plan that in many ways resembles the federal Affordable Care Act enacted by a Democratic Congress. Economists have studied the history of policy making by Republican and Democratic presidents. They find a few differences here and there, but for the most part both types of presidents play to the same middle of the country and to many of the same interest groups. But one significant difference between the two parties had been their administration of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency of the United States Treasury that enforces tax rules. A dissertation written in 2005 by Valentin Est\u00e9vez at the University of Chicago found that: \u201cUnder Democratic presidencies the audit rate of income tax returns is higher than under Republican presidencies even after the inclusion of various political and economic controls.\u201d \u201cDuring Democratic presidencies the I.R.S. tends to audit fewer individual returns and more corporate returns than during Republican presidencies.\u201d \u201cParties may be in fact resorting to more subtle redistributive policies, such as the likelihood of an audit, to favor their constituency.\u201d I.R.S. data released since Mr. Est\u00e9vez\u2019s dissertation have confirmed the tendencies of Democratic and Republican presidents to use I.R.S. audits differently. Twelve percent of millionaire earners were audited in 2011, when Barack Obama was president, compared with 5 to 7 percent audit rates for 2004-9 (George W. Bush was president most of that time). Among people earning less than $200,000, a far lower percentage of returns are audited (about 1 percent in 2011). Steven Miller, deputy I.R.S. commissioner for services and enforcement, told The Associated Press , in reference to the recent audit rates, that \u201cI.R.S. officials said the high ratio was part of an effort to demonstrate that tax laws are applied fairly.\u201d If these past audit patterns continue, whether or not millionaires can expect to meet I.R.S. auditors in 2013 and beyond depends a lot on whether President Obama defeats the Republican nominee. audits , Casey B. Mulligan , Daily Economist , Income Tax , Internal Revenue Service , politics , Taxation The Biggest Cut in Unemployment Benefits Why People Pay Income Taxes How to Avoid Reinventing the Wheel on Tax Reform Tackling Income Inequality Previous Post How the Fed Presidents\u2019 Assets Stack Up The outcome of the presidential election might help determine how many audits the Internal Revenue Service conducts and whether they\u2019re aimed more at individuals or corporations, if historical patterns hold, an economist writes."

        "text": " Residents Vote in Chinese Village at Center of Protest BEIJING \u2014 Less than two months after staging a bold protest against official corruption and chasing away their local leaders, thousands of people in the southern Chinese village of Wukan did something on Wednesday that many once thought unimaginable: They cast ostensibly independent ballots in the first step to determine the leadership of their seaside town in Guangdong Province. The voting Wednesday for a committee to supervise future elections stood as an unlikely grace note marking the peaceful denouement of a standoff against heavily armed security personnel that in many Chinese villages would have ended violently. The 11-day confrontation was diffused in late December, after senior Communist Party officials from the provincial capital reached an agreement with Wukan\u2019s self-appointed leaders, promising free elections and an investigation into the questionable real estate deals that locals say have robbed Wukan of much of its arable land. The officials also agreed to fully investigate the death of Xue Jinbo, the 42-year-old village leader who had died in police custody, and to release his body for burial. In another unexpected victory for the town\u2019s 13,000 residents, the local Communist Party last month selected one of the protest leaders to be Wukan\u2019s party secretary. Wang Yang, the Guangdong Province party chief who helped orchestrate an end to the confrontation, described Wukan\u2019s agitation as a quest for fairness and the state-owned People\u2019s Daily newspaper trumpeted the resolution as a potential model for officials managing the tensions \u2014 and distrust \u2014 that plague villages across China. \u201cThis tells us that local government must have a keen awareness of prevailing conditions in facing the interest demands of the masses, even if these involve tension and conflict,\u201d the newspaper said in December. But some of the government\u2019s promises have been harder to fulfill. Officials have yet to issue a ruling on decades\u2019 worth of land sales and they have refused to release Mr. Xue\u2019s body until his family signs a statement saying he died of natural causes, relatives said. Although they have been offered generous compensation for their cooperation, the family has refused to comply, insisting that Mr. Xue died while he was being tortured under interrogation in December. Despite the frustration of not being able to bury her father, Xue Jianwan, his 22-year-old daughter, expressed relief that the election promised by provincial officials had taken place. \u201cAll of us in Wukan share the belief that this election marks a significant moment for our village,\u201d Ms. Xue, a school teacher, said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s the first transparent election we\u2019ve had in decades, a first step towards true democracy.\u201d The 11-member election committee that Wukan\u2019s voters select on Wednesday will be charged with overseeing another election in March that will determine the village leadership. Although some analysts have described the vote as a watershed moment \u2014 one that could influence other villages in rural China \u2014 others were skeptical about the long-term prospects for full-throated democracy, given the Communist Party\u2019s stubborn resistance to sharing power. Having been established in the 1980s, local elections for the committees that manage sanitation, social welfare and other daily matters in thousands of villages are not new, but they are widely viewed as flawed. Party officials often determine who ends up on the ballot or they stage-manage and manipulate the voting. Once elected, committee members can be easily swayed by the money that readily flows from township and county-level coffers. It is land sales, the primary source for local government operations, that often prove most corrupting. Wukan residents say it was the former party secretary, Xue Chang, who sold off as much as two-thirds of village\u2019s jointly owned land, sharing most of the proceeds with his deputies. Mr. Xue, who held his post since 1970, was removed from office during the throes of the unrest that saw police cars overturned and government offices ransacked. Li Fan, an elections expert who runs the World and China Institute in Beijing, said he thought the best outcome was for an untainted election in Wukan. \u201cIt should be better given that all the media is watching,\u201d he said, referring to the scores of foreign reporters who have flocked to the village. \u201cIf it is a good election, that will be unusual for China.\u201d But Lin Jiang, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, said he hoped that this once-belligerent fishing village could serve as a powerful counterpoint to those who argue that democracy is ill-suited for China\u2019s rural citizenry. \u201cPeasants in China may be undereducated, but the election in Wukan shows that just because you don\u2019t have a good education, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t elect officials to represent your interests,\u201d he said. Yang Semao, a 45-year-old former fisherman who was one of the protest leaders, agreed. Speaking by phone on Wednesday night, he said some residents lacking proper documentation were initially barred from voting but that local officials had come up with a solution that will allow them to vote on Thursday. In all, he said 6,244 ballots were cast. \u201cOne thing I can guarantee is that we will have a fair, impartial and transparent election in March,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to see the passion for democracy among my fellow villagers. From now on, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will dare rig an election in Wukan.\u201d Shi Da contributed research."

        "text": " Peyton Manning Casts Large Shadow Over Super Bowl INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 For a Manning who isn't in the Super Bowl , this one sure is making headlines. It happened again Tuesday, when Colts quarterback Peyton Manning denied whispers that he was pondering retirement. \"I have no plans on doing that,\" he said. It's the strongest indication that, despite having his third neck operation in September, he hopes to play in the NFL when the new season kicks off later this year \u2014 something the league is happy about. \"My plan hasn't changed,\" he said. The NFL would prefer to keep the focus on this week's juiciest story lines -- Giants quarterback Eli Manning trying to outdo his older brother by winning a second Super Bowl; Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick chasing their fourth titles and maybe exacting a little revenge for their loss to New York four years ago. But as everyone knows, this is Peyton's place, his town, and fans hang on every detail of his recovery. \"It's not the way it should be,\" he said earlier Tuesday in a taped interview with ESPN. The Colts ended their most tumultuous month in more than a decade with another flurry of moves. Team officials confirmed Tuesday that they had hired Bruce Arians, Manning's former quarterbacks coach, as offensive coordinator, and Harold Goodwin as offensive line coach. They also fired tight ends coach Ricky Thomas and assistant offensive line coach Ron Prince. The whirlwind of changes began Jan. 2, the day after the Colts clinched the No. 1 overall draft pick with a league-worst 2-14 record. Irsay has since fired vice chairman Bill Polian, general manager Chris Polian, and dismissed coach Jim Caldwell and most of his staff -- a series of changes that prompted Peyton Manning to voice his complaints two days after the conference championship games. Two days later, Irsay called Manning a \"politician,\" fueling a public spat that drew national attention. The two tried to put out that fire before the team's scheduled arrivals, but the fallout has continued into this week. \"I would think he's very uncomfortable, especially with the Giants here and Eli,\" former Colts coach Tony Dungy said. \"When you get to a Super Bowl, even though it's the second (recent) one for the Giants, you want the focus to be on that achievement. He would much rather have the focus on Eli and what they've done to get here, and unfortunately, that's not going to happen.\" If there were any doubts, they were answered in a strange 24-hour period that began with the host committee's news conference Monday. Irsay joined the mayor, governor and two committee officials to discuss game-week preparations, but wound up taking most of the questions, nearly all of which focused on Manning's future. Afterward, Irsay said he didn't plan to discuss the Manning situation again this week. On Tuesday, Manning piped in. Shortly after the NFL's annual Super Bowl media day event ended, Peyton Manning met with a small group of reporters with the idea of turning the attention back to Sunday's game. \"I'm working hard, I had a really good session today,\" Manning said after repeatedly being asked about his rehab. The four-time league MVP hasn't played in more than a year because of a damaged nerve that caused weakness in his throwing arm. Doctors fused two vertebrae together, a procedure that forced him to miss the Colts two-win season. Since then, there has been rampant speculation about his recovery, the potential risks of a return, whether the Colts will pay Manning a $28 million roster bonus in early March to prevent him from becoming a free agent or whether the soon-to-be 36-year-old might retire."

Mr. Johnson knew the potential was there. So with the Pratt Area Community Council, he worked with landlords to improve conditions. Eventually, banks started making mortgages, allowing a new wave of brownstoners and small business owners who owe it all to him and others like him. \u201cYoung people moving in today should read the history to see what the old-timers like us have accomplished,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, 78. His story is the story of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. The Virginia-born Mr. Johnson moved to the city after finishing at the University of Virginia and serving in the United States Army. He landed in Clinton Hill and realized quickly that the area was most in need of responsible homeowners and historic preservation. He soon decided that he could make a larger difference in politics and was elected district leader, an unpaid political position at the lowest level of the system. Our Black History Month series is being done in conjunction with the Fort Greene Association. Mr. Johnson also worked on the crime problem, organizing community volunteers to walk and drive the streets and report crime directly to the 88th Precinct. \u201cAll the community meetings were our second job,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. As district leader, a post he held for 16 years, Mr. Johnson enlisted Pratt Institute students to work with him on a historic district that today is bounded by Fulton Street, Myrtle Avenue, Downing Street and Vanderbilt Avenue. Mr. Johnson also helped get vacant lots designated as community gardens \u2014 for the use of area residents. \u201cIf you know the right buttons to push, you can get a lot of these things done,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who has retired from politics and works as a public administrator at Brooklyn Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s good to look back and see people who moved in when I did still live here.\u201d Mr. Johnson, who is single, got out of politics, but plenty of local officials still seek his counsel. \u201cOne of the greatest things about Earl is that he genuinely cares about people,\u201d said Olanike Alabi, a Democratic district leader since 2006. \u201cHe taught me that my political survival is not based on how many elections I win, but on how I am able to stand up for people and how I make the tough decisions.\u201d The Local Salutes Black History Heroes Black History Month Collaborative Art Exhibit The Day: What To Do This Week The Day: Black History Month in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill Earl Johnson \u2014 A Grassroots Politician Who Made A Difference"

        "text": " Portugal Pulls Off Debt Auction, but Fears Remain MADRID \u2014 Portugal easily sold a new batch of short-term debt Wednesday, lifting some of the gloom after a recent surge in its borrowing costs amid concerns that the country will have to follow Greece in seeking a new bailout. Portugal auctioned 1.5 billion, or $2 billion, in three- and six-month Treasury bills \u2014 the full amount that it had targeted. The auction was more than twice oversubscribed and the yields were down from the latest such sale on Jan. 18, when Portugal sold 2.5 billion of Treasury bills. The new three-month bills had an average yield of 4.07 percent, down from 4.35 percent last month. The six-month bills went at 4.46 percent, down from 4.74 percent. The successful debt sale came amid a broader rebound on European bond markets. In Spain, the yield on 10-year government bonds fell to its lowest level since November 2010, down about 10 basis points to 4.8 percent on the secondary market. Italy\u2019s dropped even more but remains at a painfully high 5.7 percent \u2014 more than three times what Germany has to pay for its 10-year bonds. Portugal, which received a 78 billion, or $102.5 billion, bailout last May from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, continues to struggle. Portuguese five-year credit default swaps recently set record highs, indicating that investors saw a 70 percent chance that the country would still default. The yield on its 10-year government bonds was down almost a full a percentage point, to 14.28, after spiking on Monday above 17 percent \u2014 its highest level since the launch of the euro. Much of the concern centers on whether ongoing talks between Greece and its bondholders \u2014 whatever their outcome \u2014 will provide a blueprint for Portugal to renegotiate its own bailout terms rather fulfill the conditions agreed last May with international creditors. \u201cAs of today, Portugal\u2019s efforts have not succeeded in anchoring markets expectations,\u201d in terms of convincing investors that Lisbon could stick to the bailout terms, said Francesco Franco, assistant professor at the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon. Instead, he said \u201cthe Greek deal, if successful, is seen as an alternative template.\u201d Portugal and Greece are the only euro zone economies to have their debt rated as junk by all three major rating agencies, after Standard & Poor\u2019s last month followed Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service in downgrading Portugal. However, the center-right government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has insisted in recent days that it would not require further bailout money. Instead, Mr Passos Coelho has said that Lisbon\u2019s request was for more time, and that Portugal would comply with the terms of the existing bailout \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d In the short term, that cost is helping to plunge Portugal into one of the deepest recessions in the Western world, with the economy expected to contract 3 percent in 2012, rather than the 2 percent that was foreseen last June, when Mr Passos Coelho was elected. Still, because of its bailout agreement, Portugal has no need to return to the long-term debt market for further financing until next year."
