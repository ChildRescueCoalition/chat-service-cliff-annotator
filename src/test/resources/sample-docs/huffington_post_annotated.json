        "text": " Rider Strong: The Resistable Rise of the Mockumentary Actor; Filmmaker The Resistable Rise of the Mockumentary I once heard someone say that for every joke, there's a scale of 1 to 10: 1 being the most subtle version of the joke, in which you don't give any indication that there even is a joke, and 10 being the most hacky, obvious, in-your-face version of the joke. \"Friends\" operated at about an 8 or a 9. With The Office , Ricky Gervais was giving us a 3. And yeah, despite proclaiming, \"These go to 11,\" the classic mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap maintains a steady 2 on the joke-o-meter. Because that's the primary benefit of the mockumentary form: subtlety. Even on the horror end of the spectrum, where the Paranormal Activity films earn their suspense solely from night-vision shots in which absolutely nothing happens. Besides a rumbling noise in the background. Maybe a plate falls, and we jump a mile. With the recent box-office success of The Devil Inside , and looking ahead to the superpowers-based Chronicle , the mockumentary is no longer a rare, cool filmic style. It's become a standard approach to storytelling. As new directors, my brother and I have had lots of meetings in the industry recently, and during every single one, the phrase, \"found footage\" has been uttered. Hollywood wants to cash in. Genre doesn't matter anymore. Expect mockumentary romantic comedies (mock-doc-rom-coms?), mockumentary musicals, mockumentary westerns... But should this be the case? Before the onslaught continues, (and before my brother and I throw in the towel and make one of our own) I thought I'd take a moment to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the form. How it's been used... and often abused. From a filmmaking perspective, the popularity of the mockumentary makes a whole lot of sense. For both studios and independent producers, these films cost way less money, all you need is some cheap cameras and some no-name actors. There's more to it than that, though. Creatively, it's very liberating for directors. After all, it's required that the technical elements be a few steps behind, that there are a few \"pretty mistakes\" thrown in -- you know, that it looks a bit like crap. Likewise, it's an actor's dream: freed from the challenge of forcing naturalism into the demands of plot, actors are able to relax, to languish in the quirks and habits of character. But the mockumentary has its challenges, too. The biggest hurdle is the suspension of disbelief. The irony of a \"normal\" fiction film is that we accept its tricks and conventions without hesitation (assuming it's well made). Whereas when a film declares upfront that it is \"real,\" it has to keep earning our trust over and over again. The lens of a mockumentary is easier to create, but harder to maintain. For instance, once people start getting killed, or aliens start invading, the obvious question these movies beg is, \"Why the hell would someone keep filming?\" The stock solution is the conceit of the \"film geek who's obsessed with capturing everything.\" That's getting old (unfortunately, I think Chronicle follows this path). So the real heavy lifting of the form rests on the writer's shoulders. It's the writer's job to cram a traditional narrative into an anti-narrative structure; to allow the film to stumble into a story. Sometimes, they don't even try. Especially in the subgenre of \"found footage,\" there's rarely much narrative. These movies haven't really evolved since The Blair Witch Project , putting characters in worse and worse situations until the screen goes black and we're left to contemplate \"what happened?\" Like the Norwegian film, Trollhunter , which, despite some awesome effects , doesn't twist its story beyond the initial reveal that trolls exist. It just keeps showing the same basic scene over and over. Let's go over here and hunt a troll. Then head over here to... hunt another troll. Black screen! Other films go to great lengths to be as traditionally narrative as possible. Such is the case with Cloverfield , which integrates flashbacks via the idea that the footage we're watching was taped over existing footage -- which just-so-happens to be informative back-story. I think this is actually pretty brilliant, but too clever by half. There wasn't anyway to appreciate the story without simultaneously appreciating the crafty way they slipped it. Or then there's the approach of District 9 , which sidesteps a lot of problems by giving up the mockumentary structure early on, but sticking with the look. This is an interesting approach, and one that requires a level of audience habituation that I don't think would have been possible pre-reality TV. We're so used to handheld cameras, zooms, and other cinema verite techniques, that films can leap between omniscient and camera-crew P.O.V., yet stylistically remain the same. Arrested Development operated on the same principle: It was shot like a mockumentary, but no one ever looked into camera, and the show contained a complex web of flashbacks and scenes that would've been impossible for a documentary crew to capture. Call it mock-mockumentary style. For all its iterations, though, the current popularity of the mockumentary has very little to do with artistry. The truth is that the rise of the form is sign of our economically polarizing times in Hollywood. As the industry becomes more top heavy, the mockumentary is becoming the best -- and maybe only -- way for indie filmmakers to compete. Or, more accurately, to opt out of competing. How else can a tiny budget stack up against slick, $100 million films, replete as they are with gigantic crews, famous casts, and computer imaging? And for established studios, the mockumentary has become a unique marketing tool. It's the perfect way to market subtlety, regardless of whether a film is actually subtle. For most of us, if we're going to pay to see something on the big screen, we demand spectacle. With its \"bad filming\" -- its shaky hand-held look, its zooms, its whip pans, its lens flares -- the mockumentary informs us, upfront, to not seek spectacle... even when it's actually there. By lowering our expectations of spectacle and story, we don't feel as duped when we walk out having only seen one ghost for thirty seconds (well, unless its really bad ). Or if not much happens, story-wise, once the body count starts adding up. Expectation of subtlety used to be the norm. People would go to the theater to yes, watch a film where adults talked to each other about tough subjects , and maybe, if it were a really graphic and violent film, there would be a shoot out at the end. I don't think anyone's to blame for the shift to more spectacle-based cinema. The lazy, shorthand history is that great filmmakers like Lucas and Spielberg are responsible for elevating B-movies -- while at the same time, home video became the realm for subtle, talky films. Even if we agree with that version of events, I think it's undeniable that, on the whole, the craft of filmmaking has gotten better, not worse. But we should remember that the craft of filmmaking is, by definition, superficial. The aims of craft and technique are making something that looks and sounds good. Looks and sounds pleasing. Appreciating such beauty is only one part of the film-going experience. What a movie has to say, what its story makes us feel or think about -- we should be open to the idea that a non-spectacle film can achieve greatness in these areas. Especially without resorting to the \"look-at-how-subtle-my-story-is\" lens of the mockumentary. When I was in college, I was in a class with a kid who once went on a tirade against the exclamation point (you read that correctly). He believed it to be superfluous punctuation -- because it was either redundant, and therefore unnecessary, or it was too forceful. Telling you how to read a sentence! Telling you to push! He said if a sentence needed an exclamation point to indicate how to read it, it should be re-written so it doesn't need the exclamation point to begin with. I think he was being a little too forceful himself -- and soooo 19 years-old -- but if I apply his logic inversely to the mockumentary form, I think there's something to it. Because for Hollywood, the mockumentary is becoming the anti-exclamation point. The way for studios to tell us to think of this as a home movie that just maybe, mmmmaaaybe if we look close enough, might contain a story... boo! But if a movie's story is already a big spectacle (like, say, a group of kids who get superpowers ), then does it need to be a mockumentary? Why not simply make a good-looking movie with a full-fledged story? Or, if it needs the mockumentary form, then I think filmmakers face a tough question: are they using the form in order to rescue an otherwise impoverished narrative? I'll take a stand to say that none of the recent mockumentaries, despite their innovations in approach, tone, or structure, have really been able to beat Spinal Tap (Tim Robbins' Bob Roberts is a close second). Of course, Spinal Tap had the benefit of being one of the first, but I also think it is an example of a perfect marriage of subject and form. Which is something that Spinal Tap alum Christopher Guest has always been careful to do: select a subject matter that involves a certain level of spectacle already -- a folk concert , a dog show , a local theater production -- something that a documentary crew would conceivably cover, that is entertaining to watch in itself. Importantly, however, such subjects evolve from character, not external action (i.e., there's no disease wiping out humanity ). By placing the demands of spectacle outside of the story, but still tying them to the personalities on screen, the idiosyncrasies of setting and character become primary. In other words, just because mockumentaries can \"go to 11,\" we probably don't need to turn them up that high. Hypnotized by the cost and convenience of the form, I'm afraid Hollywood -- and in response, audiences -- are forgetting that an emphasis on setting and character is precisely the point of the mockumentary. It is, in fact, the only point. Watching Ricky Gervais host the Golden Globes last month reminded me how amazing The Office was when I first saw it in 2001. Today, the mockumentary form is as conventional as a laugh track. But back..."

Bevilacqua, shown in this Dec. 2, 2000, file photo taken in Philadelphia. (File, AP Photo/H. Rumph Jr.) PHILADELPHIA -- Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, championing the Vatican line on homosexuality and abortion but later coming under fire by two grand juries investigating child sex abuse allegations, has died. He was 88. Bevilacqua died in his sleep Tuesday night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, a Philadelphia suburb, after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003. Bevilacqua, trained in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in the upcoming trial of a longtime aide. Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities. In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an \"aberration, a moral evil\" and suggested gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be an active homosexual \u2013 a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare. He was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call for a \"New Evangelization,\" Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests. \"We are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out to people like never before,\" Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began in 1998. At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students. Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his late 70s. \"I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions,\" he said at age 77. \"My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic.\" He made a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights and run several miles on a treadmill at home. \"Come 8 o'clock, my day is not my own,\" he said. But he settled into retirement after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted Bevilacqua's leadership. Prosecutors said last year that not much had changed since the first investigation, when the \"abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself.\" Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is scheduled to start in March. Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004. \"With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups,\" said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants. He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y. He earned a doctoral degree in canon law from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court. In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.

So with George Clooney sitting opposite him, it was inevitable that his turn as the Dark Knight in 1997's franchise killing \"Batman & Robin\" would come up. Of course, there were a lot of things fans didn't respond well to in the fim, including as Clooney pointed out, \"They put nipples on the batsuit.

Twelve soldiers were also wounded in the attack Tuesday night in the Marwarh area of Baluchistan province, said the paramilitary Frontier Corps. The troops returned fire, but officials did not indicate whether the attackers suffered any casualties. A local government official, Fateh Bangalzai, said soldiers discovered the bodies of seven unarmed men near the checkpoint Wednesday morning. Authorities were investigating whether the men were part of the attacking group or civilians caught in the crossfire, said Bangalzai. Insurgents in Baluchistan have long demanded greater autonomy and a larger share of the province's natural resources. Pakistan has also been fighting a violent Taliban insurgency over the past few years that aims to topple the government, partly because of its alliance with the United States. It has launched a series of offensives in the northwest along the Afghan border, but the militants have continued their attacks. Pakistani fighter jets bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the Afghan border Wednesday, killing up to 31 insurgents, government and security officials said. One of those killed was reported to be a Pakistani Taliban leader in Orakzai region named Moin ud Din, said one security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. It was not possible to independently confirm the information because the border region is effectively off-limits to reporters. Militants have in the past disputed army accounts of casualties, and human rights groups say civilians often die in military actions. There were air strikes in the bordering regions of Kurram and Orakzai, said government officials Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul. The attacks followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram that killed over 60 people in the last week. Associated Press writer Hussain Afzal contributed to this report from Parachinar, Pakistan. PARACHINAR, Pakistan -- Pakistani fighter jets bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the Afghan border Wednesday, killing up to 31 insurgents, government and security officials said."

        "text": " Azeem Ibrahim: Muslims in America 2012 - Who Will They Vote For? Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s International Security Program Muslims in America 2012 - Who Will They Vote For? Council On American-Islamic Relations Muslim Voters In December last year, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) announced their 2012 \"Muslims Vote\" campaign. A 2012 presidential voter guide is available, they have an online registration tool and a video, as well as a presence on Twitter. The hope is to encourage participation in the election among young Muslim voters as CAIR recognizes that with a large Muslim population in key swing states such as Ohio, Florida and Michigan, the Muslim vote potentially has great influence. The overall Muslim population in the US is an estimate and somewhat controversial depending on which communities are included. But it is generally accepted that there are between 3 and 5 million Muslims in the country, and that this number is growing. CAIR's GOTV campaign will hopefully make an impression on Muslim voters as the 2012 election approaches. Certainly, their Voter Guide questions have helped reveal the prejudices of some of the presidential candidates. With four of the more outspoken candidates out of the race, CAIR's Voter Guide profiles on the rest tend to feature their attitude towards Islam and toward civil rights. On Santorum, for example, it notes that he \"supports indefinite detentions of suspected terrorists without charges at the Guantanamo Bay prison\" (and) \"Endorses racial and religious profiling, specifically of American Muslims and young men, in order to enhance security at airports.\" But CAIR in a news release saves its most pointed criticism for Newt Gingrich, calling him \"one of the worst promoters of anti-Muslim bigotry.\" CAIR spokesman Corey Sayolar said that this was in response to Gingrich's comment that he would only hire Muslims in his administration if they renounced Sharia as a tool for American government. In January 2012, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down an Oklahoma ban on the application of \"Sharia law\" and \"international law\" in courts. Any further attempts to raise this issue in order to get votes from a fearful and ill-informed electorate will hopefully be dealt with in similar fashion by the courts. It may not be enough however, to prevent candidates from raising the Sharia law issue as a divisive wedge in their campaigns if they think it will serve their purpose. Other ugly incidents, like the fundamentalist pastor who wanted to publicly burn a copy of the Koran, controversy over the siting of the Moslem Community Center in downtown Manhattan and anti-Sharia law initiatives, have only encouraged the bigotry of some TV commentators and media spokespeople. It can be argued that this sort of anti-Muslim rhetoric, while hardening the fanatics on the right, will end up alienating most moderate thinkers in the electorate. In recent races where xenophobic rhetoric and fear mongering was used to get votes, it turned out that it was the amount of money spent on a race, not the rhetoric that determined the outcome. It is considered unlikely that these tactics will work in a presidential election when substantial turnout means that the hard right base will not have a disproportionate influence. There appears to be an inherent conflict for most Muslims when choosing sides. Conservative Republicans are more likely to be anti Muslim, as most of the Republican presidential candidates have proved. But the conservative nature of the Republican party appeals to many similarly conservative Muslims, giving them a limited field to choose from. So who will these Muslims vote for this year in the Republican presidential primary? Ron Paul is the one Republican candidate who may get support from Muslims who see his libertarian philosophy as similar to their ideology. His position on foreign policy appeals as he wants the US to immediately stop its military involvement in the Middle East, repeal the Patriot Act and limit funding to Israel. Zahra Siddiqui, a political science major at the University of Illinois, said recently, \"Ron Paul knows how to differentiate between Muslims and terrorists, and he would never sacrifice any citizen's liberties over security.\" But Brian Gaines, a political science professor specializing in voting behavior and elections at the University of Illinois, notes that generally Muslims in America today do not vote like other religious groups. \"Muslims are unique in that the more religious they are, the more Democratic they tend to vote,\" said Gaines. This is possibly because Muslims who attend mosques regularly are more likely to also be community minded, socially active and aware, as well as being conservative and religious. Gaines says it is unlikely that Obama would lose votes from this population to a Republican candidate. Muslims in the U.S. haven't always leaned Democratic. Before 9/11 many Muslim-Americans were Republican voters but the way they were treated by the Bush administration and the rise of anti-Muslim feeling in the country helped to change their attitude. 55 percent of Muslim-Americans say it has become more difficult in live in the United States since the 9/11 attacks, according to the 2011 Pew Research Center findings. A recent poll showed that 76 percent of Muslims in America approve of Obama's performance. His moderate voice in Middle East politics, his support for an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his response to calls for change and democracy with the Arab Spring movement have all gained him support from Muslim Americans. But there remains a sense of wariness as anti-Muslim sentiment continues and Obama's opposition to the Palestinian effort to have their statehood recognized by the United Nations disappointed many and contributes to political caution. But for the vast majority of the electorate, the economy trumps most other issues. Candidates who continue to raise anti-Muslim fears should be seen as irrelevant distractions from the real problems of the economy, jobs, civil rights, education and health care. With Ron Paul not considered a viable presidential candidate for the Republic party, Muslim voters, as they were in the last election, don't seem to be spoilt for choice. It seems for many the best bet would be to give President Obama four more years to fulfill those early promises.

        "text": " Tom Ortenberg: Wolves Are a Great Benefit, Not a Danger, in the Real World CEO, Open Road Films Wolves Are a Great Benefit, Not a Danger, in the Real World The Grey is the #1 movie in America. Response to the film has been spectacular with top national critics like Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone and A.O. Scott of the New York Times lauding The Grey and Liam Neeson's incredible performance with superlatives. The Grey is the story of a group of oil workers fighting for survival after their plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness and they are hunted by a pack of wolves. It's a great story and thrilling to watch on the big screen, but that's all it is. Fiction. Fantasy. Made up. Realized on the big screen by filmmaker Joe Carnahan, who I had the privilege of working with on his first film, the no-budget thriller Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane , as well as his 2002 follow up film, Narc. In the real world -- not the one dreamed up by filmmakers -- the return of wild gray wolves is one of the greatest conservation success stories in the history of the United States, and experts say that wild wolves pose almost no threat to human safety. I am writing this to make those points extremely clear. When settlers spread west in the 19th and early 20th century, wolves were seen as a threat. They were plagued by mythical baggage that goes back centuries in Europe depicting wolves as, well, \"the big bad wolf.\" Wolves have big teeth and would sometimes kill livestock -- fueling the perception of danger. So we tried to get rid of every last one of these \"evil\" animals by shooting, trapping, and poisoning them. Unfortunately we did a great job, and by the 1930s wolves were eradicated from almost the entire lower 48 states. Fast-forward to the mid-1990s in the northern Rocky Mountains, when wolves had begun crossing the border from Canada and recolonizing parts of their old habitat in the U.S. portion of the northern Rockies. And then in 1995 and 1996, the federal government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. The positive ecological changes that have resulted from the return of the wolf in Yellowstone have been nothing short of astonishing. With the return of their primary predator, formerly complacent elk have again begun behaving like wild elk, which has allowed streamside plants and trees to flourish. This streamside vegetation benefits songbirds, trout, beavers, and other wildlife. The benefits of the return of wolves have trickled down throughout the ecosystem and been a great ecological boon for Yellowstone. At the same time, there have been no wolf attacks on humans in the northern Rockies in the decade and a half since the wolf's return. Simply put, an attack by a wild wolf on a human is extraordinarily rare. With The Grey , filmmaker Joe Carnahan, along with producers Jules Daly and Ridley Scott, present a great -- and fantastical -- story of man versus the wild that, at its heart, is an exciting and touching story of man versus himself. That's not to say wolves are gentle herbivores. They do sometimes kill cattle and sheep. While statistically wolves account for a tiny percentage of livestock losses, a calf or a lamb lost to a wolf is a real loss for the owner of that animal. And when wolves prey on livestock, such wolves are usually killed. Therefore, conflicts between wolves and livestock are bad for wolves, bad for livestock, bad for livestock producers, and bad for wildlife enthusiasts. Fortunately, non-lethal conflict-prevention practices exist, and more and more ranchers are employing these practices in wolf country. Such methods include using guard dogs, deploying riders on horses to accompany livestock, penning animals at night, using electric fencing, and other practices. Hopefully these methods will continue to be implemented more often and more resources will be made available for these conflict-prevention practices. Today, gray wolves live in the upper Midwest and the northern Rockies, as well as in Alaska and Canada. Wolves are also slowly beginning to make a comeback in the Pacific Northwest, and just a few weeks ago the first wild wolf in more than 80 years showed up in California. The discovery of OR-7, or \"Journey,\" as he has become known, made headline news in California and across the country. The return of the wolf is an amazing conservation success story, but plenty of misunderstanding about wolves still exists today. Some activists have decided that The Grey is somehow the enemy of wolves and set their sights on boycotting the movie. This effort seems grossly misguided. The Grey will not harm wolves. We need to remember to separate fact from fiction when it comes to this charismatic carnivore.

        "text": " Amb. Marc Ginsberg: Time to Reset Russia's Syrian Offense Former U.S. Ambassador to Morocco Time to Reset Russia's Syrian Offense It's high time to toss aside diplomatic niceties and place Russia in the diplomatic stockade, along with China and India for good measure (which are Russia's fellow UN Security Council offenders), in its conspiracy to shelter the illegitimate Bashar al-Assad from global wrath. Pure and simple, the Kremlin's ignoble efforts to \"slow mo\" any collective international action against the outlaw Syrian regime is, I regret to say, the diplomatic equivalent of facilitating felony murder. Moscow deservedly earns the indictment given Russia's reckless racketeering on behalf of Assad's regime as it transforms Syria into a free fire zone. So where are the marches of outraged fraternal Arab allies on Russia's Middle East diplomatic posts? Under the cover of Vladimir Putin's full court protection, Assad's security forces have unleashed the bloodiest offensive yet against defenseless Syrians. Major Syrian cities are under indiscriminate tank and artillery fire, including the outskirts of Damascus, which had been under growing rebel control. By latest count over 6,500 Syrian civilians have died, and countless tens of thousands more have been tortured and wounded. Assad has reverted full throttle to his father, Hafez's \"Hama Rules\" 1982 playbook -- surround Syrian cities and unleash a merciless barrage of indiscriminate fire power against any edifice in the crosshairs: homes, buildings, schools, hospitals, you name it no matter who and how many men, women and children are killed and wounded. If Americans and the rest of the world could see for themselves what is now taking place in Syria's restive cities, the media would be in a feeding frenzy demanding concerted international action against the perpetrators. Alas, if there is one thing Assad did right to save his regime, it was to deny the media independent access to Syria. In 1982, the elder Assad massacred 20,000 of his own citizens. \"Baby Doc\" Bashar is nothing more than a crueler chip off the old block -- who would have guessed that the once gentle ophthalmologist could muster the evilness to wreak such havoc on his population? Good tutoring from Putin and Ahmadinejad? At the rate the younger Assad is murdering his own people he just may exceed his father's 1982 atrocity. The Kremlin ordered its envoy to the UN Security Council to block a benign draft resolution proposed by Morocco on behalf of its fellow Arab League members to propose that Bashar al-Assad yield the Syrian presidency to his deputy and develop a transitional unity government that would organize elections within two months. The draft resolution has been so watered down as a sop to Russian sensitivities by its Arab and European sponsors that it neither calls for military action by Council members, much less additional economic sanctions. Yet Moscow has warned that the draft is \"unacceptable\" (aka veto bait). Perhaps Prime Minister Putin should use this interregnum between Council meetings to reflect on the consequences of his actions. If Russia vetoes the resolution, which is a reasonable path to a political settlement inside Syria, it would constitute a vote against fundamental principles of the UN Charter and a good part of the democratic world should be outraged; but, knowing Putin, not surprised. It may take longer, but Assad and his clique will eventually be gone -- but at what cost to Syria's future stability? An all-out civil war brought to us no less than by a callous Kremlin? As I wrote in these pages last October, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution which merely \"condemned\" the violence committed by the Assad regime, portending Russia's determination to shelter Assad from any pressure to make tangible concessions to his political opponents. Russia has been the Assad family's steadfast global \"muscle\" for over 50 years. Syria is one of the Kremlin's most profitable arms purchasers (and as we speak Russian arms are pouring into Syria). But Putin has made a bad bet staying in bed with Assad. In the end, when Assad is brought before the World Court in the Hague, or is hunted down like Gaddafi, the Syrian people will not soon forget that it was Russia that enabled Assad's killing fields. Unfortunately, given the diplomatic squabble over a relatively toothless resolution the impending showdown in the Security Council will not produce a decisive plan to force Assad's finger off the trigger. It will take the leadership of the Arab League's key players, along with Turkey, to lay the groundwork for something more than what the Russians will abide by. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that it was his government's goal to facilitate an internal Syrian solution without outside military intervention. So why is Russia rushing more and more arms to Syria -- if that is not military intervention by design, what is? If he is to be believed, the U.S., Europe and their Arab allies should keep the Security Council in round the clock session until hell freezes over (to coin a historic demarche made by then U.S. envoy to the U.N. Adlai Stevenson during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis) to force Russia into accepting a resolution that paves the way for that very internal solution the Russians claim they support. That, at the very least, is what it has come down to at the UN when dealing with Assad's atrocities and may be the last best chance to avert an even bloodier and dangerous civil war inside Syria that would spill over throughout the region. P.S. Memo to the White House: The Kremlin is acting at the UN and bilaterally as if there was no reset in relations. Further Russian arms shipments to Syria as long as the violence escalates is like pouring fuel on an escalating fire. It is outrageous and the Russians should be called out on the continuing arms transfers to Assad. Time to get that button out again. Follow Amb. Marc Ginsberg on Twitter:"

        "text": " Al Gore: Troubled Oceans at the Bottom of the World Troubled Oceans at the Bottom of the World Today we visit the Weddell Sea, which lies to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula. Like the rest of the Southern Ocean, the body of water that surrounds Antarctica, it is home to diverse ecosystems that are filled with unique and astonishing wildlife. And like oceans everywhere, the impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent. As the world warms, its waters are warming, too. Increased temperatures have already led to changes in ocean life. For example, on the other side of the Peninsula, king crabs have invaded an area previously considered far too cold for their survival. The impact of the arrival of these predators, for the first time in millions of years, could be catastrophic for the surrounding ecosystem, which has evolved exotic and unique life forms that have no defenses against crabs. Unfortunately, scientists are observing not only changes to the oceans' temperature but also to its chemistry. The Weddell Sea -- and the rest of the Southern Ocean -- is experiencing what scientists call ocean acidification. Currently, about a quarter of the carbon dioxide released each year by human activities is absorbed by the world's oceans. The Southern Ocean alone absorbs more than 40% of that due to the frigid temperatures of its waters. As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases, the water becomes more acidic. As one scientist described it to me, ocean acidification is the \"osteoporosis\" of the world's oceans. As the ocean acidifies, the exoskeletons of marine animals become brittle and frail, just as osteoporosis weakens the bones of humans. Acidification can also affect the nervous systems, blood circulation, and breathing of fish and other animals in the sea. In other parts of the world, acidification may cause tissue damage in economically important species of fish , threaten the survival of rare or endangered shellfish , and reduce the number of species in coral reefs. If left unchecked, this fundamental alteration to ocean chemistry has the potential to threaten the livelihood and food security of millions, if not billions, of people worldwide. And, what does this mean for us? About 1 billion people in the world rely on fish and shellfish as their primary source of dietary protein. By one estimate, the effect of acidification on mollusks alone (animals such as oysters and clams) could cost the world tens of billions of dollars by the end of the century. Some researchers have called acidification \"one of the most critical anthropogenic threats to marine life.\" The climate crisis is a problem of multiple dimensions. Rising ocean temperatures alone have the potential to disrupt the web of life in the ocean. Acidifying oceans, a result of the same carbon dioxide pollution that is warming our planet, are magnifying the problem even further.

        "text": " Michael Roth: Go Positive! President, Wesleyan University It's been more than a little depressing to listen to debate performances over the last couple of months, in which candidates seem to gain in popularity by refining a formula of indignation and hostility. \"How dare you,\" says the candidate, puffing out his chest, wondering how any questioner could sink so low to ask about a character flaw. The same candidate then dives even lower to cast aspersions on anyone who might be considered a rival. The research tells us why the candidates \"go negative.\" It works. SuperPac donors know where to invest, and they are investing in negativity in a big way. The Wesleyan Media Project research shows outside money \"went from about 3 percent of total ad airings in the 2008 race to almost half, about 44 percent, in 2012.\" As we leave Florida and head out to Nevada, I'm afraid we can only expect more of the same. I'm embarrassed to say that one of the key places where candidates and citizens acquire a taste for -- and skills in -- negativity is higher education. For decades now, we have promoted a culture of criticism in which you show how smart you are by tearing apart somebody else's ideas. That's a lot safer than showing how you might build your own set of ideas into something meaningful. In my recent book, Memory, Trauma and History: Essays on Living with the Past , I urge my colleagues to go beyond this culture of criticism to practices of creative exploration. Here is an excerpt from one of the essays in the book, \"Beyond Critical Thinking.\" I doubt that this [cultivation of negativity] is a particularly contemporary development. In the eighteenth century, there were complaints about an Enlightenment culture that only prized skepticism and that was only satisfied with disbelief. Our contemporary version of this trend, though, has become skeptical even about skepticism. We no longer have the courage of our lack of conviction. Perhaps that's why we teach our students that it's cool to say that they are engaged in \"troubling\" an assumption or a belief. To declare that one wanted to disprove a view would show too much faith in the ability to tell truth from falsehood. And to declare that one was receptive to learning from someone else's view would show too much openness to being persuaded by an idea that might soon be deconstructed (or simply mocked). In training our students in the techniques of being critical, we may be giving them reasons to remain guarded -- which can translate into reasons not to learn. The confident refusal to be affected by those with whom we disagree seems to have infected much of our cultural life: from politics to the press, from siloed academic programs (no matter how multidisciplinary) to warring public intellectuals. As humanities teachers, however, we must find ways for our students to open themselves to the emotional and cognitive power of history and literature that might initially rub them the wrong way, or just seem foreign. Critical thinking is sterile without the capacity for empathy and comprehension that stretches the self. But the contemporary humanities should do more than supplement critical thinking with empathy and a desire to understand others from their own point of view. We should also supplement our strong critical engagement with cultural and social engagement by developing modes of teaching that allow our students to enter in the value-laden practices of a particular culture to understand better how these values are legitimated: how the values are lived as legitimate. Current thinking in the humanities is often strong at showing that values that are said to be shared are really imposed on more vulnerable members of a particular group. Current thinking in the humanities is also good at showing the contextualization of norms, whether the context is generated by an anthropological, historical, or other disciplinary matrix. But in both of these cases, we ask our students to develop a critical distance from the context or culture they are studying. Many humanities professors have become disinclined to investigate with our students how we generate the values we believe in, or the norms according to which we go about our lives. In other words, we have been less interested in showing how we make a norm legitimate than in sharpening our tools for delegitimization.... If we humanities professors saw ourselves more often as explorers of the normative rather than as critics of normativity, we would have a better chance to reconnect our intellectual work to broader currents in public culture. This does not have to mean an acceptance of the status quo, but it does mean making an effort to understand the practices of cultures (including our own) from the point of view of those participating in them. This would include an understanding of how cultures change. For some, this would mean complementing our literary or textual work with participation in community, with what are often called service-learning courses. For others, it would mean approaching our object of study not with the anticipated goal of exposing weakness or mystification but with the goal of turning ourselves in such a way as to see how what we study might inform our thinking and our lives. The fact that language fails according to some impossible criterion, or that we often create misunderstandings in our use of it, is no news, really. It is part of our finitude, but it should not be taken as the key marker of our humanity. The news that is brought by the humanities is a way of turning the heart and the spirit so as to hear in the languages people use the possibilities of various forms of life in which we might participate. When we learn to read or look or listen intensively, we are not just becoming adept at exposing falsehood or at uncovering yet more examples of the duplicities of culture and society. We are partially overcoming our own blindness by trying to understand something from another's artistic, philosophical, or historical point of view.... Of course hard-nosed critical thinking may help in this endeavor, but it also may be a way we learn to protect ourselves from the acknowledgment and insight that humanistic study has to offer. As students and as teachers, we sometimes crave that protection because without it we risk being open to changing who we are. In order to overcome this blindness, we risk being very uncomfortable indeed. My humanities teachers enriched my life by showing me details and patterns and relations. In so doing, they also helped me to acquire tools that have energetically shaped my scholarship and my interactions with colleagues and students. It is my hope that as guides, not judges, we can show our students how to engage in the practice of exploring objects, norms, and values that animate diverse cultures. In doing so, students will develop the ability to converse with others about shaping the objects, norms, and values that will give substance and character to their own lives. They will develop the ability to add value to (and not merely criticize values in) whatever organizations in which they participate. They will often reject roads that others have taken, and they will sometimes chart new paths. But guided by the humanities they will increase their ability to find together ways of living that have meaning and direction, illuminating paths immensely practical and sustaining."

The Aqua Team went home in Week 1 before even stepping foot onto \" The Biggest Loser \" (Tue., 8 p.m. EST on NBC) Ranch. They were tasked with losing a combined 50 pounds at home in a month for a chance to get back into the house and into the game. But while they were at home working hard -- and boy did they, clocking in 14 hours days at the gym! Adrian and Daphne easily earned their spot back in the game, but while Daphne seemed mostly accepted into the Black Team, Adrian's reception into the Red Team wasn't nearly as positive. Particularly when it came to Kim and Conda. Conda has been at the center of every bit of drama in the house since the beginning, though she always sees it as the other person's fault. With her old targets gone, she set her sights on Adrian. After he talked about those 14-hour workouts, she and Kim decided he was taking digs at their own work ethics, and further that they didn't believe him anyway. They figured he needed to prove it in the gym. So he did, keeping up easily with their Week 4 workouts, and even surpassing them in some respects. So Conda then decided that it hadn't been a very grueling contest. The two women gossiped about him to each other and tried to stir it up with others in the house until finally Mark and Nancy called a Red Team meeting to try and get it all out. The meeting, though, didn't do much to clear the air. In fact, Conda sat there quietly as if she had nothing to say until finally someone pulled it out of her. Then she was ready with the eye rolls and smirks to Conda-scend. Daphne felt pretty bad for her brother's reception on the Red Team, though they would have probably turned on her as well. At the weigh-in, neither Aqua Team member performed that well, but they weren't alone. Nevertheless, despite weak performances by most of the members of both team, the Aqua Team was looked at as failing to hold up their end of the bargain. Mark went so far as to call it strategic gameplay, as they had also earned Immunity this week. By a narrow margin, and with a terrible percentage of weight lost, the Black Team won the weigh-in and the Red Team voted to send Nancy home. She'd sat out almost every challenge, and was even chosen to sit out the weigh-in this week. Had she been counted instead of a few other people, they might have won as she outperformed them. Nevertheless, she went home and is enjoying continued weight loss and more time with her enormous family.

Referring to President Obama's now-famous rendition of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together,\" Leno asked the First Lady, \"Did you ever think at this point in your lives together he [President Obama] would become a singing sensation? Did you ever think that would happen?\" She responded, \"No. No. Not at all.

        "text": " Howard Foster: Republicans and the Hispanic Vote Lawyer Republicans and the Hispanic Vote I hear the advice from the pundits over and over again: Mitt Romney needs to appeal to Hispanic voters. Therefore, he should stop talking about illegal immigration. The premise is that Hispanic voters favor high levels of illegal immigration and will not vote for a candidate who wants to end it. But what empirical evidence is there for this assumption? In the surveys I have seen Hispanics rate immigration as a minor issue. And that does mean that those who care about it want more illegal immigration. So the premise that downplaying tough talk about cracking down on illegal immigration leads to Hispanic votes just does not hold up. Romney has been campaigning fairly aggressively against illegal immigration. He has repeatedly said he favors deportation of all illegals in the country, mandatory use of e-verify by all employers, and opposes the so-called Dream Act. Newt Gingrich accused him of being \"anti-immigrant,\" which Romney vehemently denied. Yet Romney won the Hispanic vote in the Florida Republican primary 54%-29% (Fox News exit poll). Hispanics also constituted a significant 14% of the voters in the primary. This tells us two important things: Hispanic voters are slightly more pro-Romney than the electorate, and they are not repelled by the idea of cracking down on illegal immigrants. And their 14% share of the Republican primary electorate is almost equal to their share of the state's population. There is a significant share of the Hispanic population in Florida (many are Cubans who have always voted Republican) that is conservative and Republican. It's simply wrong to say those people are offended by talk of cracking down on illegal immigration. Could it be that they are opposed to illegal immigration in principle, and this is is something that is appealing about the Republican brand? If Gingrich had won the Hispanic vote, and it was therefore out of step with the rest of the state's electorate, there would be reason to question whether opposition to illegal immigration were an impediment to winning over Hispanic voters. But that was not what happened. And it is now fair to ask why Republicans should not make illegal immigration a key issue. It would seem every segment of the Republican electorate is on board.

The problem affects 14 lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of generic Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol tablets.

Ahead of the big day, host David Letterman was joined by his first-ever guest on the show, Bill Murray , plus Regis Philbin , who has appeared on the show a whopping 43 times. How better to celebrate than for the three showbiz veterans to indulge in some football in honor of Sunday night's big game? The hair may be whiter and more sparse than in 1982, and the knees may have been creaking, but Murray gamely pulled on a uniform to show off his placekicking prowess. As the pipes swirled outside the Ed Sullivan Theater, the irrepressible Reege ran out in his referee's uniform to take charge of proceedings. With a besuited Letterman looking oddly out of place kneeling down on 53rd Street as placekick holder, Murray ran up for three place kicks. The crowd is on its feet... He hit the upright on the first attempt and misjudged his second kick. However, on the third try, tears in his eyes as he lines up this last kick , Murray scored. The crowd goes wild... He didn't exactly threaten Lawrence Tynes or Stephen Gostkowski for a place at the Super Bowl, but one from three wasn't too shabby for a 61 year-old. The celebrations continue on \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" Weeknights, 11:35 p.m. \"Super Bowl XLVI\" airs Sunday, Feb. 5, from 6 p.m. EST on NBC.

Can comedy bring our two worlds closer together? If you believe the US State Department cables disclosed last week, American entertainment programs like the Late Show with David Letterman are actually combating jihad. It must be great to be an executive like Jeff Zucker and make zillions of dollars, continually getting moved upwards even as you make decisions that have ruined the once top network. This year being the 25th anniversary of the release of the Talking Heads' concert classic Stop Making Sense, I spoke with Talking Heads Jerry Harrison and Chris Frantz on the cult favorite. What do the revelations of David Letterman's workplace sexcapades tell us about the new era of sexual harassment? Quite a bit, actually. The most-improved broadcast series of the new season is Grey's Anatomy, and the most improved on basic cable is FX's gritty, riveting Sons of Anarchy. Two narratives emerged from the taping of the Late Show Monday afternoon: (1) Dave apologized on air, to his staff -- and his wife; and (2) Dave told jokes. About it. I have always greatly admired David Letterman, and consider him to be one of the defining wits of our times. That said, David might consider putting a plastic cover on that Late Show couch."

Abby Elliott joined the cast in 2008, followed by Nasim Pedrad in 2009 and Vanessa Bayer in 2010. While all three have begun to forge their own identities on the legendary sketch comedy show, one of their most memorable roles has been as a trio. The three comediennes have made numerous appearances on the show as the sisters Kardashian. So Cohen put them to the test, asking each of them questions that they would then have to answer as their respective Kardashian sister. While all three put on similar air-headed personas and nasally voices, they do use different inflections and accents to differentiate the sisters. The women proved they knew some stuff about the people they were parodying as well. Elliott knew Khloe had never graduated college, while Pedrad was able to name Kim's \"not-such-a-hit single,\" as Cohen called it. Bayer was given a tough one, given how disparate the Kardashians are in height and how close they are in age. She had to put them in age order.

        "text": " Art Brodsky: An AT&T/Verizon Story:  Why Nothing Is Ever 'Over' in Washington Communications Director, Public Knowledge An AT&T/Verizon Story: Why Nothing Is Ever 'Over' in Washington This is a great week for taking a step back for a good look at how Washington works. It's also a great demonstration of that wonderful saying, \"It's never over until it's over. And it's never over.\" On the menu are AT&T's failed takeover of T-Mobile, a bill to set rules for spectrum auctions, a payroll tax bill pending in Congress, a bill to change FCC procedures, and Verizon's planned collaboration with Comcast and other cable companies. They all have something in common: big companies trying to obtain their fair advantage over consumers and competitors. In these cases, it's generally in the wireless market. When we last left AT&T, it had ditched its $39 billion takeover plan. It had spent tens of millions in the pursuit of buying out its competitor, recruiting all of its minions on Capitol Hill. (It even tried giving away a tractor at an event attended by influential politicians.) But the deal didn't pan out in the face of plain old common sense. One might think that AT&T would just let it die, and move on. But no, AT&T still is smarting from the loss and is taking out its ire at being thwarted on its poor, unsuspecting customers. analysts on Jan. 26, AT&T Chairman Randall Stephenson took out the collapse of the deal on everyone but AT&T. He chastised the FCC, noting that, \"this FCC has made it abundantly clear that they'll not allow significant M&A to help bridge their delays in freeing up new spectrum.\" By \"significant M&A,\" he means merger and acquisition (M&A) activity which consisted of his second-largest wireless company taking over the fourth-largest wireless carrier, a deal opposed by the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, state attorneys general, consumers and public-interest groups from around the country. As a result of what AT&T sees as the Commission's misguided actions, the company is taking it out on the customers with higher prices and more throttling of data. Stephenson chastised the FCC for paying attention to detail: \"Even the smallest and most routine spectrum deals are receiving intense scrutiny from this FCC, oftentimes taking up to a year and sometimes longer before these are approved.\" Never mind $1.9 billion spectrum purchase from Qualcomm. when he said Stephenson \"wore his resentment for the FCC on his sleeve,\" and was still stuck in the second stage of grief. He has three more to go, and it's evident how the company will act out put it, AT&T is \"spoiling for a fight\" with the Commission. This is where the \"isn't over\" part comes in. One might think that the merger was an event to be considered as one and done. Not so. It has carried over to Capitol Hill in AT&T's support for a couple of bills, one which would give AT&T a competitive advantage in the wireless business and another which would severely restrict the FCC's ability to carry out its statutory responsibilities. The spectrum legislation is due to be worked in to the overall payroll tax reduction bill, so that's how something seemingly unrelated to the wonderful world of telecommunications like payroll tax winds up here. House Republicans have drawn up legislation that Senate Communications Subcommittee Chairman John Kerry (D-MA) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS) both opposed , while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called it \"the single worst telecom bill\" he has ever seen. There are parts to the bill that are problematic. One is that the FCC couldn't impose any restrictions on who participates in auctions. They couldn't exclude the biggest companies that already have most of the spectrum, in an effort to help smaller ones. That gives the advantage automatically to the biggest companies, like AT&T, while helping AT&T and Verizon to maintain dominance in the wireless market and further tilting that market into duopoly through spectrum policy. The GOP bill also would limit the FCC's ability to impose service conditions on auctions, something it has always done. Gone would be guarantees of nondiscrimination, or conditions related to making spectrum available on a wholesale basis. AT&T strongly endorsed the bill more than once, with Stephenson saying at the earnings call that \"it appears the FCC is intent on picking winners and losers rather than letting these markets work,\" ignoring the fact of course that AT&T with Verizon dominate the market. He also scorned the idea that an agency which has conducted complex auctions for years might take umbrage at the idea that Congress should write the auction rules favoring big companies: \"A lot of recent comments and speeches about certain members of this FCC suggest that they and not Congress should decide how spectrum auctions are conducted, including who can participate and what the conditions should be for participating. Meanwhile, we pile more and more regulatory uncertainty on top of an industry that is a foundation for a lot of today's innovation, making it difficult for all of us to allocate and commit capital.\" It's not difficult at all. Invest in your network. Use the spectrum you have sitting around. There are, to be sure, Not content to pick a fight with the FCC over spectrum, AT&T also is endorsing another Republican effort that would restrict the rest of what the FCC does. restrictions on conditions the Commission could impose on a merger and would require rules to be based on \"market failure.\" Of course, AT&T didn't like the Net Neutrality condition the FCC put on its takeover of BellSouth in 2006, and the bill would in theory prohibit it. The larger point is that the bill would turn 75 years of communications law on its head. Instead of relying on a fundamental concept of the public's interest, convenience and necessity in a rule, or in the interest, convenience and supposed necessity. The irony, of course, is that AT&T has pretty much had its way with the FCC up until the attempted takeover. In the most blatant example, it demolished and dominated the Commission on open Internet rules, beating Chairman Julius Genachowski into submission multiple times by getting letters signed by the company's pet members of Congress and ginning up \"grass roots\" letters from companies and groups generally unaware of what was being proposed or the impact on them, first after Genachowski's Sept. 2009 speech on an open Internet in a successful attempt to alter the drafting of proposed rules, and again when the chairman emerged in Sept. 2010 to propose a more modest \"Third Way\" to guarantee some measure of public protection for the Internet by a regulatory agency. AT&T doesn't like to lose, even once, so it will retaliate by throwing its weight around Congress in a vendetta against the FCC. Perhaps they would have done this anyway without the sting of a T-Mobile defeat. Then they would have been sore winners instead of sore losers. But here AT&T's continued action show the company's ability to keep an issue going in multiple ways, even if one seems closed off to them. And just to get its last licks in, AT&T also took what might be considered a shot at Genachowski's grand ideal to have broadband deployed everywhere. Stephenson said that, \"we've all been trying to find a broadband solution that was economically viable to get out to rural America and we're not finding one to be quite candid.\" Even enough, it appears. Meanwhile, Verizon, the other major beneficiary of the spectrum legislation, is keeping a low profile for the time being. Its strategy is to do what AT&T is doing but only more subtly. Rather than be crude and buy out the largest competitor, Verizon is going into business with it - or more correctly -- with them. It cut a deal with the biggest cable companies, which paid $2.4 billion for spectrum in a 2006 auction and then sold it to Verizon for $3.6 billion. Along with the spectrum sale, however, are the side deals, which could raise the company's profile. Verizon Wireless will market cable company high-speed Internet service everywhere but where Verizon offers its fiber optic FiOS service. There will be a big fight at the FCC, which has to approve the spectrum transfer, about the side marketing arrangements. Verizon would be a big beneficiary as well of a bill like the one AT&T endorsed which would eliminate the traditional public-interest standard in favor of the industry-interest standard. Unlike the AT&T takeover, which was rather blatant in its anticompetitive aspects, Verizon's is more subtle but just as dangerous. Verizon Wireless is dividing up the world between it and Comcast, Time Warner and Bright House, the owners of the spectrum being purchased. Customers would still have fewer choices in landline Internet access by lack of action, rather than positive action. Look for this deal to get more prominent in the coming weeks. It has already attracted the attention of the Antitrust Division, and chances are Verizon will have to defend it to some in Congress as well.
