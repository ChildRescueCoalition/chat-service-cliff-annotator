TBR will officially field Patrick's No. 10 Chevrolet in all 10 of her Sprint Cup Series races this season. It will begin the season with the points Dave Blaney earned last season for the No. 36 car. Because Blaney finished 33rd in points last season, his car is guaranteed a starting spot in the first five races of the season. Teams can transfer or sell the points to another team, and Stewart-Haas Racing acquired them so Patrick is guaranteed to race in the Feb. 26 season opener. TBR will field the No. 10 for David Reutimann in the 26 races that Patrick does not have on her schedule. "

        "text": "Bats: Teixeira Sets His Sights on Small Ball After spending the 2011 season watching line drives get eaten up by infielders aligned toward right field, Mark Teixeira is finally ready to play some small ball. Teixeira was noticeably affected last year by the defensive shifts that sent three infielders to the right side of the field when he batted left-handed. He had been reluctant to change his pull-oriented approach ' perhaps sending a few bunts down the third-base line ' because he thought it would hurt his power and productivity. But Teixeira batted just.224 from the left side of the plate , and frustration finally took its toll. Teixeira said Tuesday night that he was eager to experiment with bunting once the Yankees convene for spring training in Tampa, Fla. He said he might attempt one bunt each game. 'I always mess around with it, but it's something you can't work on without live pitching,' Teixeira said. 'I may lay down 20 bunts this spring.' Teixeira said the last time he recalled bunting was as a freshman in high school. He added that he beat the throw to first to notch a base hit. Teixeira, who was honored Tuesday night in Manhattan at the annual Thurman Munson Awards Dinner, which benefits the AHRC-New York City Foundation, said he had already made another important adjustment this off-season. He lost a considerable amount of weight, he said, by changing to a healthier diet. And he was was light-hearted when asked about the Yankees' competition this year. Teixeira joked that the pitching machines at Bobby Valentine's baseball academy in Stamford, Conn., where he trains in the off-season, began to malfunction after Valentine was named manager of the Boston Red Sox. Also noting the additions of first basemen Prince Fielder and Albert Pujols to the American League this winter, he said, 'If I get one or two votes for the All-Star Game, I'll be happy.' Tyler Kepner, David Waldstein, Andrew Keh and other contributors will bring baseball fans inside the 2012 baseball season with news and analysis of the Yankees, Mets and the rest of Major League Baseball. The Yankees slugger Mark Teixeira is looking for ways to beat the infield shift that stymied him last season. Kyle Williams, a receiver for the 49ers, faced criticism for mishandling two punt returns in the N.F.C. Championship game. His father Ken, the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, is not a fan favorite either. Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, speaks about the state of the game at the White Sox fan convention. With two natural first basemen on the roster, Manager Jim Leyland will have to put one of them at a suboptimal position. Which configuration would be the least inefficient? The arrest of the Dominican baseball player who used the name Fausto Carmona on Jan. 19 has brought to light the problem of identity fraud among players from the Caribbean nation. A trustee seeks hundreds of millions for victims of Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and a trial is scheduled to begin on March 19. "

        "text": "Russia Stands in the Way of U.N. Call for Assad to Step Down Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, prime minister of Qatar, seated at center, and Nabil al-Araby, left, secretary general of the Arab League, at the Security Council on Tuesday. UNITED NATIONS ' The battle over Syria moved to the United Nations on Tuesday with Western powers and much of the Arab world confronting Russia and its allies in the Security Council over their refusal to condemn the Syrian government for its violent suppression of popular protests. As top diplomats gathered in the Council chamber for the showdown, the drumbeat of violence continued without pause in Syria, where government forces used heavy weapons and tanks to push rebels back from strongholds near Damascus. At the United Nations, the two sides skirmished over a draft Security Council resolution proposed by Morocco that calls for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power as the first step of a transition toward democracy. But behind all the arguments lurked the ghost of Libya, with Russia determined to block any resolution that might be construed as a license for regime change. The Arabs and top Western diplomats argued that endorsing the demonstrators was the minimum step required to support popular demands for change that began with peaceful demonstrations and have evolved into an increasingly armed uprising. 'The Syrian government failed to make any serious effort to cooperate with us,' Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, told the Security Council about Arab League efforts to mediate the dispute. 'The government killing machine continues effectively unabated.' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, joined by the foreign ministers of Britain, France and several other countries, argued that Libya was a 'false analogy.' The plan for a gradual democratic transition 'represents the best efforts of Syria's neighbors to chart a way forward, and it deserves a chance to work,' she said. The proposed resolution, which most likely would not be voted on before Friday, called for Mr. Assad to cede power to his vice president, who would help form a unity government that would prepare for elections. It is unlikely that Mr. Assad would heed the demands to step down, even if the resolution made it through the Council. But that remained a long shot Tuesday night. Fundamentally, the argument over Syria reflects a deeper divide between those who would use the Security Council to confront nations over how their governments treat civilians, versus those who consider that it has no role whatsoever in settling domestic disputes. Syria is the latest example in an argument that stretches back through all recent conflicts. Russia, backed discreetly by China and India, rejects the idea that the world organization can interfere in the domestic politics of any country to force a leadership change. They all feel that they were duped into supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, which was promoted as a means to protect civilians last March. Instead, they said, NATO used it as a license to help overthrow the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Churkin, adopted a 'where will it all end' argument, telling reporters that the Security Council cannot prescribe ready recipes for the outcome of a domestic political process. 'Once you start, it is difficult to stop,' he said, adding that pretty soon the Council would start pronouncing 'what king needs to resign, or what prime minister needs to step down.' To a certain extent, the Arab League and the much of the world were ready to dump the eccentric Colonel Qaddafi because he had made many enemies. Mr. Assad, despite hostile relations with some neighbors and the West, continues to have a strong ally in Russia, yet analysts described Moscow as preoccupied with leadership change. 'That the Morocco resolution 'calls for' Assad to step aside is their worst example and fear,' said George Lopez, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and a sometime adviser to the United Nations. 'If today it is Assad, tomorrow Putin? They worry.' Yet in a sign that Russia was beginning to feel the need to deflect at least some of the accusations that Moscow is partly responsible for not stemming the rising death toll, Russia distanced itself from Mr. Assad himself. The United Nations stopped tallying deaths after they passed 5,400 in January, saying they were too difficult to confirm accurately, and since then the toll has mounted steadily. Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Ellen Barry from Moscow. 'The Russian policy is not about asking someone to step down; regime change is not our profession,' Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation during a stop on a tour of Asia. 'We are not friends or allies of President Assad,' he went on, according to a transcript on the Interfax news service. 'We never said that Assad remaining in power is a precondition for regulating the situation. We said something else ' we said that the decision should be made by Syrians, by the Syrians themselves.' Mr. Lavrov made it clear that it was the example of Libya, where foreign powers intervened with force, that forged Russia's opposition. 'The international community unfortunately did take sides in Libya and we would never allow the Security Council to authorize anything similar,' he said. There is no Western nor Arab League support for the kind of international military intervention that occurred in Libya, because of concerns that an implosion of Syria could drag neighbors like Israel, Iraq and Lebanon into a wider conflagration. The goal is to try to stanch it without setting off a sectarian civil war. In the longest and most emotional speech of the day, Ambassador Bashar Jaafari of Syria evoked the famous Arab poet Nizar Qabbani and the long Arab struggle against colonialism to insult Qatar and others leading the effort to support political change in Syria, suggesting they were joining a Western plot. But Sheik Hamad and Nabil al-Araby, the Arab League secretary general, both pleaded with the Council that more international pressure was needed to meet the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people after 11 months of demonstrations. The league strategy ' used as a blueprint for the resolution ' mirrors that applied in Yemen, and promoted by Arab states, whereby the longtime autocratic president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, transferred power to his vice president after months of often bloody pro-democracy protests. Critics suggest that strategy aims merely to stop the violence without promoting real change. With Syria, other calculations also come into play. Vladimir V. Putin, who seeks to return to the Russian presidency in elections this March, wants to portray Russia as regaining its superpower influence. Russia's long ties to Syria generate billions of dollars in weapons sales, plus the relationship gives Moscow the entree it needs to the table for Middle East peace talks. In addition, the Russian Navy deploys some ships from the Syrian port of Tartous, widening Russia's sphere of influence into the Mediterranean. In the West, the interest in pressuring Mr. Assad to leave is partly rooted in the desire to weaken the position of Syria's ally, Iran, in the region, as well as that of Hezbollah, which continues to back the Damascus government. The haggling over the wording is expected to commence in earnest again on Wednesday. Russia and China vetoed a similar resolution last October. Diplomats have inserted all kinds of reassuring language into the paragraphs that touch on Russian sensitivities. 'Nothing in this resolution compels states to resort to the use of force or the threat of force,' it said, a point many foreign ministers echoed in their speeches, and it underscores the 'strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria, emphasizing the need to resolve the current crisis in Syria peacefully.' It also calls on both the government and the rebels to halt the violence, although it does not equate the two sides as Russia often does. The official Syrian position is that it is under armed attack from terrorists from abroad. That explanation ignores the protest movements sweeping the region. Members of the Syrian National Council, a nascent government in exile, lobbied for the resolution, rejecting a Russian offer to sponsor talks in Moscow between the government and the opposition. Burhan Ghalioun, the president, said that even if the resolution passed, Mr. Assad would be likely to reject it. "

        "text": "Music Review: Wagner&#x2019;s &#x2018;Rienzi&#x2019; From Opera Orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall Rienzi Onstage from left, Emily Duncan-Brown, Ian Storey and Eve Queler, conductor of the Opera Orchestra of New York, joined at Avery Fisher Hall by singers in the Vox Nova of the Special Music School. 'Rienzi,' Wagner's third opera , is seldom performed. Even the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, Germany, has yet to present it. There are many reasons. For one, it's long. At the opera's 1842 premiere in Dresden, the performance, including intermissions separating its five acts, ran more than six hours. Wagner later sanctioned many cuts to make the piece more doable. 'Rienzi' also poses epic challenges, including a big chorus, marches and processions. Musically, it is the young Wagner's attempt to do a German version of a French grand opera, and then some. The conductor Eve Queler has long been a champion of 'Rienzi.' In 1980, in the ninth season after founding the Opera Orchestra of New York , she conducted the work at Carnegie Hall. She revived it in 1982 and 1992. On Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall she conducted 'Rienzi' again with the orchestra, an effective concert performance with a good cast led by the British tenor Ian Storey. Ms. Queler stepped down as music director of the Opera Orchestra last year. The ensemble's 2011-12 season began in November with its new music director, Alberto Veronesi, conducting Cilea's 'Adriana Lecouvreur.' Ms. Queler, who recently turned 76, walked a little gingerly, but conducted with confidence. The playing of the orchestra and the singing of the admirable New York Choral Society (directed by John Daly Goodwin) was sometimes tentative, understandably so, given the unfamiliarity and difficulties of the work. But under Ms. Queler the sweep, color and character of the opera came through vividly. The story, set in Rome in the mid-14th century, centers on Cola di Rienzi, a Roman tribune and populist who envisions a unified Italy. He becomes caught in the hostilities between two patrician families, the Orsinis and the Colonnas. When Rienzi leads forces that defeat the nobles, the people rally to his cause. But he is a classic flawed hero whose good intentions spin out of control. By the end the nobles, the church and even the people have turned against him. Wagner may have had the French grand operas of Meyerbeer in mind when he wrote 'Rienzi,' but the score exudes Italianate style. Whole stretches of ornate melodic lines inspired by bel canto soar over repetitive accompanimental patterns in the orchestra. Yet the music also has Romantic flourishes and symphonic majesty. There are hints of 'Tannhuser,' 'Lohengrin' and more. Mr. Storey, who had the gravity and vocal heft for the daunting title role, sang with stamina and intelligence. Sometimes his sound was grainy, and his sustained tones wobbled. But you could only be grateful to this veteran Wagnerian for learning for this concert a role that he will have few other chances to sing. As Irene, the soprano Elisabete Matos brought a steely sheen and impressive power to her singing. The mezzo-soprano Geraldine Chauvet won an enormous ovation for her performance in the pants role of Adriano Colonna, who is in love with Irene. Ms. Chauvet's rich, dark voice turned patchy in a few exposed flights. But this was singing of throbbing expressivity and style. The cast was winning over all, especially the baritone Ricardo Rivera as Orsini, and the bass-baritone Brandon Cedel as Raimondo, the papal legate. Some young artists made strong contributions in smaller roles, including Philip Horst, Jonathan Winell, Shannon DeVine and, as the Messenger of Peace, the sweet-toned Emily Duncan-Brown. Ms. Queler fared pretty well at the traffic-cop demands of conducting 'Rienzi,' which included battalions of brasses in the balconies, the West Point Cadet Glee Club during a soldiers' chorus (talk about typecasting), and the endearing children from Vox Nova of the Special Music School, who marched down the aisles in white robes, singing an angelic chorus beautifully. The Opera Orchestra of New York will perform Verdi's 'Simon Boccanegra,' with Placido Domingo in the title role and Alberto Veronesi conducting, on March 7 at Avery Fisher Hall; (212) 906-9137, operaorchestrany.org.

        "text": "Daily Stock Market Activity Wall Street closed a strong month narrowly mixed on Tuesday as weaker-than-expected economic reports surprised investors after a stream of positive data in recent months. Still, stocks rallied sharply in January, partly on hopes the American economy will dodge the effects of a recession in Europe. But those hopes were dented Tuesday, with home prices in the United States and business activity in the Midwest missing expectations. Consumer confidence also dropped. The market was sharply lower in the late morning, but erased much of that loss, repeating a pattern in recent trade that has been seen as a sign of resilience. 'Once you start to get some negative numbers, especially around the consumer, it lends to the argument that G.D.P. growth is not really there and it is going to go back to zero,' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.81 points, or 0.16 percent, to 12,632.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.60 point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,312.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,813.84. Earnings reports continued to paint a muddled picture. Exxon Mobil fell 2 percent to $83.74 and was the biggest drag on both the Dow and S.& P. 500 Exxon's profit narrowly beat expectations as rising oil prices offset falling margins on chemicals and fuel, and production fell short of some estimates. Robert Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC Capital in New York, said depressed interest rates and a stalling of gains in industrial copper are pointing to a short-term reversal in economically sensitive sectors, like materials and banks, that have led the rally. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 204 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported results so far, 59.8 percent topped estimates, tracking below the beat rate at this stage of the earnings season in recent quarters. Hopes that Greece would reach a deal with private creditors on a debt swap and receive a bailout to sidestep a chaotic default raised market sentiment initially. Investors again flocked to the safety of United States securites. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 to 101 27/32. The yield fell to 1.80 percent, from 1.85 percent late Monday. Shortly after the opening bell, the S.& P. 500 piereced a bullish technical level, known as a golden cross, as its 50-day average ticked above its 200-day average. The signal indicates a shift in momentum and usually means gains in the index within six months. In 26 golden crosses since 1962, the S.& P. 500 gained an average 4.1 percent over the next three months and was positive 73 percent of the time. In the next six months it gained 6.6 percent and was positive 81 percent of the time, according to Birinyi Associates. In January, the S.& P. 500 gained 4.4 percent, its best month since October. The Dow rose 3.4 percent for its fourth straight month of gains, while the Nasdaq advanced 8 percent. Results from Pfizer and Eli Lilly both topped expectations. But Pfizer trimmed its 2012 outlook and Lilly repeated its forecast for a drop in 2012 earnings. Lilly rose 1.2 percent, to $39.74 and Pfizer dipped 0.8 percent, to $21.40. Transportation stocks dipped as United Parcel Service gave up early gains to fall 0.7 percent, to $75.65. The package delivery group posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit , but analysts cited profit-taking and company comments on euro headwinds in the first quarter. Housing stocks fell after the S.& P./Case Shiller report on home prices. The Dow home construction index declined 1.7 percent. Lennar, a home builder, lost 2.9 percent, to $21.49. "

        "text": "Square Feet: In Philadelphia&#x2019;s Market East, Sign Law Spurs Investment The Gallery at Market East in central Philadelphia will lease part of its third floor to the Philadelphia Media Network. PHILADELPHIA ' An influx of new residents, stores, restaurants and hotels in Center City has largely bypassed Market East, the blocks of Market Street east of City Hall to Independence Mall. The Philadelphia Media Network will take the third floor of the former Strawbridge & Clothier department store. Plans for the area have included shiny glass retail pavilions, multiplex movie theaters and a Disney indoor amusement park, all of which foundered for various reasons. Still, over the last few months, the district's fortunes have brightened, prompted in part by the imminent arrival of a large new office tenant. The tenant is Philadelphia Media Network , which publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News, as well as a Web portal, philly.com. It recently signed a lease for 125,000 square feet that will straddle the third floor of the old Strawbridge & Clothier department store building on Market Street and part of the third floor of the adjoining Gallery at Market East , a fortresslike, 1.1-million-square-foot indoor shopping mall that opened in 1977. The mall has three anchor stores, but it has struggled to attract tenants for the upper floors and is only 62 percent occupied. Philadelphia Media Network will be the first business to take advantage of a sign ordinance that Philadelphia passed last summer to help create a digital district in the Market East section. It allows developers, in exchange for an investment of at least $10 million, to put up and collect revenue from large digital signs and billboards on the outside of Market Street buildings between Seventh and 13th Streets. Philadelphia Media Network will have two digital signs on Market Street and two on Ninth Street, and each sign will be about 14 feet wide and 45 feet long, said Joseph F. Coradino, the president of Preit Services and Preit-Rubin, the commercial development and management subsidiaries of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust , the company that owns both the Gallery and the old Strawbridge site. The sign ordinance has limits. For example, it will allow digital signs to appear only on properties that have 100 feet or more of frontage on Market Street. 'This is not Times Square, where the goal is to basically cover buildings with signs,' said Paul R. Levy, the president of the Center City District , a business improvement group and an early supporter of the ordinance. 'Our goal here was to integrate the signs into the existing architecture.' Still, for Philadelphia Media Network, the prospect of new digital signage 'added to the attraction' of coming to the area, said Michael Kuritzkes, the general counsel for the company, which came out of bankruptcy in October 2010. He said plans now called for the company to move from the historic, 525,000-square-foot Inquirer building on North Broad Street, where offices are spread out among more than 10 floors, to the space on Market Street, where 'everyone will see everyone else in a very collaborative way.' The Inquirer building was sold last fall to the developer Bart Blatstein. 'For a very historic, traditional newspaper company to make a change in culture, this is a terrific place to be,' he said. At the Gallery a long-anticipated overhaul has yet to get under way, although city officials say Preit has presented a plan to make the mall livelier and the stores more accessible to shoppers on the street. To attract new retailers, the company hopes first to woo both fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants to a property that now has only two food courts. 'We think food should be the real focus first,' Mr. Coradino said. Alan Greenberger, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, said city officials were working with Preit to simplify the mall's complicated ownership so that it can more readily attract private financing. 'The trigger event for Market East will be the redo of the Gallery,' he said. One developer that already has a large stake in the Market East neighborhood is SSH Real Estate , a commercial real estate company based in the city. In 2008, it helped form a partnership that eventually acquired Girard Square, a set of four buildings that straddle a full city block across the street from the Gallery. At SSH, plans have long called for building a high-rise that would sit on the site of one of the buildings at Girard Square, and in December the company, along with its partners, teamed with National Real Estate Advisors , a large equity investor based in Washington, to help it reach its goal. Jeffrey J. Kanne, the president and chief executive of National Real Estate Advisors, said that building would include a fitness club, a 200- to 300-unit residential tower and a 250-room hotel, in addition to retail spaces. Despite a recent boom in residential and hotel development, new restaurant rows and a recent expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, Center City's retail market remains spotty. While some streets, like Walnut and Chestnut, are continuing to draw both national and international retailers, the consensus is that the area could use more midprice retailers, like a long-hoped-for Target store in Market East, where retail spaces of more than 25,000 square feet are still relatively easy to find. One new tenant on Market Street is TJX Companies, the retailer based in Framingham, Mass., that operates stores under both the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls names. It signed a lease in December for 26,000 square feet of space on the corner of 11th and Market Street, for what may possibly be a new Marshalls store, said Michael J. Katz, the leasing agent for the Jenel Management Corporation, the New York-based real estate company that owns the site. The site is now occupied by a Staples store, and it sits on a modest stretch of Market Street that includes drugstores, cellphone shops and a two-acre street parking lot that was once promoted as a site for the Disney amusement park. 'The signage will show retailers that the area is changing,' Peter C. Soens, a partner at SSH Real Estate, said of the new ordinance. 'There is very strong interest from retailers that they want to be in Center City, and Market East is now the only part of Center City where you can get a large footprint.' "

        "text": "Anthony Bevilacqua, Ex-Head of Philadelphia Archdiocese, Dies at 88 PHILADELPHIA (AP) ' Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, died Tuesday night at his suburban residence, a spokeswoman said. He was 88. Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna Farrell said Bevilacqua died in his sleep at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003. Bevilacqua, trained in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in the upcoming trial of a longtime aide. Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities. In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an \"aberration, a moral evil\" and suggested gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be an active homosexual ' a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare. He was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call for a \"New Evangelization,\" Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests. \"We are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out to people like never before,\" Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began in 1998. At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students. Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his late 70s. \"I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions,\" he said at age 77. \"My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic.\" He made a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights and run several miles on a treadmill at home. \"Come 8 o'clock, my day is not my own,\" he said. But he settled into retirement after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Prosecutors said last year that not much had changed since the first investigation, when the \"abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself.\" Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took orders from Bevilacqua. Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004. \"With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups,\" said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants. He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y. He earned a doctoral degree in canon law from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court. In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. "

        "text": "Portugal Pulls Off Debt Auction, but Fears Remain MADRID ' Portugal easily sold a new batch of short-term debt Wednesday, lifting some of the gloom after a recent surge in its borrowing costs amid concerns that the country will have to follow Greece in seeking a new bailout. Portugal auctioned 1.5 billion, or $2 billion, in three- and six-month Treasury bills ' the full amount that it had targeted. The auction was more than twice oversubscribed and the yields were down from the latest such sale on Jan. 18, when Portugal sold 2.5 billion of Treasury bills. The new three-month bills had an average yield of 4.07 percent, down from 4.35 percent last month. The six-month bills went at 4.46 percent, down from 4.74 percent. The successful debt sale came amid a broader rebound on European bond markets. In Spain, the yield on 10-year government bonds fell to its lowest level since November 2010, down about 10 basis points to 4.8 percent on the secondary market. Italy's dropped even more but remains at a painfully high 5.7 percent ' more than three times what Germany has to pay for its 10-year bonds. Portugal, which received a 78 billion, or $102.5 billion, bailout last May from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, continues to struggle. Portuguese five-year credit default swaps recently set record highs, indicating that investors saw a 70 percent chance that the country would still default. The yield on its 10-year government bonds was down almost a full a percentage point, to 14.28, after spiking on Monday above 17 percent ' its highest level since the launch of the euro. Much of the concern centers on whether ongoing talks between Greece and its bondholders ' whatever their outcome ' will provide a blueprint for Portugal to renegotiate its own bailout terms rather fulfill the conditions agreed last May with international creditors. 'As of today, Portugal's efforts have not succeeded in anchoring markets expectations,' in terms of convincing investors that Lisbon could stick to the bailout terms, said Francesco Franco, assistant professor at the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon. Instead, he said 'the Greek deal, if successful, is seen as an alternative template.' Portugal and Greece are the only euro zone economies to have their debt rated as junk by all three major rating agencies, after Standard & Poor's last month followed Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service in downgrading Portugal. However, the center-right government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has insisted in recent days that it would not require further bailout money. Instead, Mr Passos Coelho has said that Lisbon's request was for more time, and that Portugal would comply with the terms of the existing bailout 'whatever the cost.' In the short term, that cost is helping to plunge Portugal into one of the deepest recessions in the Western world, with the economy expected to contract 3 percent in 2012, rather than the 2 percent that was foreseen last June, when Mr Passos Coelho was elected. Still, because of its bailout agreement, Portugal has no need to return to the long-term debt market for further financing until next year. "

        "text": "Sony Elevates Kazuo Hirai to President and C.E.O. TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp named Vice President Kazuo Hirai as president and CEO, replacing Howard Stringer who will step down from day-to-day management in a long-expected change for a company struggling to regain its driving force in consumer electronics. Stringer will remain chairman of the company until June, when he will become chairman of the board of directors, a separate post that will not be directly involved in company management, Sony spokeswoman Mami Imada said. The are no plans to replace him in the chairman's role, she added. Sony announced the changes ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, which is expected to forecast the company will post a net loss for the fourth year in a row as its TV division bleeds red ink. Hirai will take over on April 1. The last year has been brutal for many Japanese companies, hit by a strong yen that hurt exports, and two natural disasters -- the March earthquake in Japan and record floods in Thailand. But Sony has also come under fire for losing the innovative edge behind products like the Walkman and the Playstation, and ceding ground to rivals such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics as consumers snapped up their iPhones, iPods and Galaxy gadgets. The urbane and English-speaking Hirai, 51, will have to plot a course to revitalize the electronics giant as consumers lose interest in its products and gravitate instead towards smartphones and tablet PCs from other brand names. Sony's shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since Welsh-born Stringer, who turns 70 later this month, took the helm as CEO in 2005. In contrast, Apple shares have galloped ahead more than 1,000 percent, while Samsung, a maker of smartphones, flat panels and computer chips, is up more than 100 percent over the same period. ANOINTED SUCCESSOR Hirai was effectively anointed as Stringer's successor last March when he was promoted to head Sony's consumer products and services businesses, which produce the bulk of Sony's $85 billion in annual sales. He made his name in the PlayStation video games division, once a key profit driver for Sony that fell into the red for four consecutive years until he took the reins and pulled it back into the black two years ago. \"The path we must take is clear,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday. \"To drive the growth of our core electronics businesses -- primarily digital imaging, smart mobile and games; to turn around the television business; and to accelerate the innovation that enables us to create new business domains.\" Stringer, a former journalist who later ran U.S. broadcaster CBS, was brought in as a rare foreign CEO at a top Japanese company to shake things up and restore its innovative edge in consumer electronics. Many analysts though see his major achievement as cost cutting. Stringer's restructuring efforts included selling off TV factories in Spain, Slovakia and Mexico and outsourcing more than half of its production to other companies, including Hon Hai Precision Industry, the contract electronics maker that also counts Apple as its key customer. In recent months, Sony exited an LCD panel joint venture with Samsung, which will allow it to procure screens for its TVs more cheaply. It also agreed to buy out Ericsson's half of their smartphone venture for $1.5 billion to shore up its position in a market where Apple and Samsung have become leaders. Sony's share of the flat-panel television market has been eroded by the rise of Samsung and a host of nimbler Asian players, while a hacking scandal last year undermined confidence in its management. Many of Japan's other electronics titans have also stumbled in recent years. In the current reporting season, Nintendo and Sharp Corp both issued bigger-than-expected loss projections for the full year. South Korean rivals such as Samsung have been particularly aggressive in investment and blessed with favorable currency movements, while Apple has stolen much of the innovative thunder that once emanated from Japan. Sony reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday, when it is also due to brief the media on the management reshuffle. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S gave a consensus forecast of just 8.8 billion yen ($115.41 million) in operating profit for the key October-December quarter, when consumers spend heavily on gadgets for year-end gift-giving, and 8.2 billion yen for the full financial year to March. ($1=76.25 yen) "

Mr. Johnson knew the potential was there. So with the Pratt Area Community Council, he worked with landlords to improve conditions. Eventually, banks started making mortgages, allowing a new wave of brownstoners and small business owners who owe it all to him and others like him. 'Young people moving in today should read the history to see what the old-timers like us have accomplished,' said Mr. Johnson, 78. His story is the story of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. The Virginia-born Mr. Johnson moved to the city after finishing at the University of Virginia and serving in the United States Army. He landed in Clinton Hill and realized quickly that the area was most in need of responsible homeowners and historic preservation. He soon decided that he could make a larger difference in politics and was elected district leader, an unpaid political position at the lowest level of the system. Our Black History Month series is being done in conjunction with the Fort Greene Association. Mr. Johnson also worked on the crime problem, organizing community volunteers to walk and drive the streets and report crime directly to the 88th Precinct. 'All the community meetings were our second job,' Mr. Johnson said. As district leader, a post he held for 16 years, Mr. Johnson enlisted Pratt Institute students to work with him on a historic district that today is bounded by Fulton Street, Myrtle Avenue, Downing Street and Vanderbilt Avenue. Mr. Johnson also helped get vacant lots designated as community gardens ' for the use of area residents. 'If you know the right buttons to push, you can get a lot of these things done,' said Mr. Johnson, who has retired from politics and works as a public administrator at Brooklyn Supreme Court. 'It's good to look back and see people who moved in when I did still live here.' Mr. Johnson, who is single, got out of politics, but plenty of local officials still seek his counsel. 'One of the greatest things about Earl is that he genuinely cares about people,' said Olanike Alabi, a Democratic district leader since 2006. 'He taught me that my political survival is not based on how many elections I win, but on how I am able to stand up for people and how I make the tough decisions.'

        "text": "In Crown Heights, a Renaissance With Unease Franklin Avenue, once peppered with drug dealers and run-down properties, is the center of a renaissance in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. Young Brooklynites gather on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, often waiting an hour on weekends to get into Barboncino, a stylish and spacious four-month-old pizza restaurant named for a toy poodle. In 1991, the police tried to quell violence between Hasidic Jewish and black residents. The riots stigmatized Crown Heights. But up the block at JamRock Kitchen, a narrow Jamaican take-out place catering to the neighborhood's dwindling Caribbean population, business has been sporadic since it opened four years ago. These are two divergent snapshots of a remarkably refashioned commercial strip that 20 years ago was marred by drug dealers and dilapidated storefronts in a neighborhood torn apart by racial and religious violence. Now Franklin Avenue is the epicenter of a renaissance, the next subway stop on Brooklyn's gentrification express. But unlike the transformation in Park Slope or Williamsburg, this story is different ' and far more complicated ' because it is set on scarred earth. The riots that exploded between blacks and Hasidic Jews in August 1991 stigmatized Crown Heights as violent and intolerant. It has taken two decades for the tensions to ease, and now the neighborhood is absorbing a new jolt to its still-fragile dynamic: the influx of mostly white artists, young professionals, families and entrepreneurs seeking affordability. Beneath the pulsing energy on and around Franklin Avenue, there is an undercurrent of unease, suspicion and resentment from some longtime residents, a legacy of the riots. 'There's not a hostility amongst these groups, but, being an old timer, I don't see that warmth and neighborliness kicking in yet because folks are still strangers,' said John Flateau, 62, a Crown Heights native and chairman of the department of public administration at Medgar Evers College. 'There's a social cohesion gap right now.' One Hasidic landlord posted a complaint on a local news Web site about the immodesty of the new 'yuppies,' rallying his neighbors to take back Crown Heights. Some wary African-American and West Indian residents, including those who complain of being priced out of the area, expressed fears that the demographic change would force people who have endured the neighborhood's worst moments to move. For years, Crown Heights has been a diverse and divided community with West Indians, Caribbeans and African-Americans concentrated in the northern part and Hasidic Jewish groups in the southern part. But the white population in the area around Franklin Avenue has increased 15 percent in the last 10 years, according to the 2010 census. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood increased 36 percent in 2011, according to a rental market report by a brokerage firm, and two-bedroom apartments renovated with luxury touches now start at around $1,800 per month, a local real estate agent said. Three new apartment buildings are either fully rented or sold. A one-family town house just off Franklin Avenue was listed at nearly $1.1 million recently, a sum that no one could have begged for, let alone asked, two decades ago. With a heavier police presence along Franklin Avenue, crime has dropped significantly in the past decade, but is still an issue, and some black business owners say they have been harassed by the police. And, some of those owners said, the influx of newcomers has not translated into more customers. 'I thought I would be doing a lot better being so close to the subway, but new people rotate in and out of the neighborhood,' said Conrad Hunter, 36, the owner of JamRock Kitchen. Many of his target customers ' West Indian and Caribbean residents ' are leaving the neighborhood. 'You're just floating to keep your head over water,' he said. 'Is it bringing new revenue? It's not.' A corner grocery at Lincoln Place and Franklin where Ms. Williams shops, Bob and Betty's, is now selling organic food , mostly to young newcomers, and giving away cardboard boxes to older residents moving out. Tony Fisher, who took over the store his father, Bob, opened 31 years ago, remembers when holdups on the block were routine. While thrilled with the change, he is also a bit resentful. 'I look at all these newcomers and these new businesses on Franklin Avenue and I think they are jumping on a bandwagon,' Mr. Fisher said. 'Where were they 25 years ago?' Linda McKenzie, 50, took advantage of the new climate to open the thriving Veggies Natural Juice Bar, persuaded by a relative living in Crown Heights that Franklin Avenue was changing. 'But I did not expect it to go in this direction so quickly,' Ms. McKenzie said. The juice bar attracts a mix of old-time Jamaican residents and newcomers. Evangeline Porter, 79, who founded the Crow Hill Community Association 25 years ago, remembers chasing drug dealers off Franklin. Her group planted trees on the block 10 years ago, and they are finally blooming. 'Franklin Avenue is my baby,' said Ms. Porter, who recounted a recent conversation with one landlord. 'He said to me, 'You're letting these people come in and take over.' I told him, 'I am.' ' Ms. Porter, who is black, criticized African-American merchants for being complacent in rebuilding the neighborhood years ago and praised many of the 'young Caucasians' for attending community meetings. 'They saw the potential of the neighborhood and said, 'What can we do to help?' ' she said. Kevin Phillip, 40, grew up in Crown Heights and started a T-shirt business 13 years ago. Now with his wife, Garnett, he owns the Candy Rush, an ice cream and candy store on Franklin Avenue, and is bullish about the avenue's future. 'I don't think anybody really thinks about what happened here,' he said, referring to the riots. 'It's more what's happening here.' The riots erupted when a driver from a Hasidic official's motorcade struck and killed a 7-year-old black boy, which prompted black residents to take to the streets, some calling for revenge. A 29-year-old Hasidic scholar visiting from Australia was attacked and fatally stabbed. Richard Green, who founded the Crown Heights Youth Coalition in the mid-1980s, said the racial violence occurred in part because blacks and Jews had kept to themselves. 'We were never really formally introduced to each other,' Mr. Green said. 'That's a good lesson as we see new groups coming in.' Despite the transformation of the northern part of Crown Heights into a vibrant neighborhood filled with handsome 19th-century brownstones, the recent past is hard to shake. Real estate brokers last spring tried to rebrand the neighborhood ProCro, a hybrid of the names Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the area, saw it as an unvarnished attempt to increase the neighborhood's appeal by blurring its name. 'I was offended,' said Mr. Jeffries, who grew up in Crown Heights. 'The collective efforts of the black and Jewish neighbors are what made Crown Heights the destination and the attractive neighborhood it is today.' "

        "text": "City Braced to Ride Out Storm as Tevez Stays MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - The transfer window has slammed shut on Manchester City's hopes of selling outcast Carlos Tevez this season, leaving them with a gifted striker who has probably burned too many bridges to be of any use to their Premier League title push. Should Tevez return from self-imposed exile in Argentina and join his team mates for training, City face the prospect of having to resume paying high wages for a player who manager Roberto Mancini has said has no future at the club. The league leaders had stopped his salary since he left for his homeland without their permission in November and imposed a fine of six weeks' pay on him for gross misconduct - a punishment he is appealing to the Premier League over. Legal experts say City could probably find a way to terminate his contract if he continued to not turn up for work but the club would then lose out on a transfer fee as the player would be a free agent. The high-risk option would be to release him and sue him for the loss of a transfer fee that local media estimate at 25-30 million pounds but there would be no guarantees for City that Tevez would be able to pay it. \"They are effectively at a stage of brinkmanship - there is not a lot that City can do other than ride out the storm,\" Matt Taylor, an associate at international law firm Eversheds, told Reuters. \"They can't do what you would ordinarily do in this situation and terminate the contract. \"If Manchester City wanted to be very aggressive and put down a marker for the whole of football to say that players aren't allowed to ride roughshod over clubs, they could consider terminating his contract for non-performance on Tevez's part and sue him for their losses. \"That would really take the wind out of his sails because then he would be facing a legal suit for 30 million pounds. \"But that's not very attractive for Manchester City because they have then got to go after an individual for the money... There would be all sorts of difficulties with tying him down to a particular legal jurisdiction and enforcing any judgment that goes against him.\" There is a precedent for a club suing a former player for compensation with Chelsea having pursued Adrian Mutu after sacking him when he tested positive for cocaine in 2004. City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak last week issued a strongly worded statement saying the club would hold Tevez to his contract if no buyer was found in the January window. That could mean further fines if Tevez continues to breach his contract by staying away or if he does return he will be expected to resume training. Even if he does start attending the Carrington training sessions, his chances of ever playing a match for the club he once captained look slim. DOOR SHUT Mancini said Tevez was \"finished\" after refusing to warm up in a Champions League game at Bayern Munich in September and while he later held out an olive branch, he has since shut the door on a return. But that was before Mancini's optimism of an imminent sale was wiped out as interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain came to nothing. The Italian, who said this week there were no personal problems between him and Tevez, could possibly do with a striker as the Argentine's absence has left him with only three to choose from and Mario Balotelli is serving a four-match ban. Mancini has been visibly tired of fielding Tevez-related questions at news conferences and while the matter does not appear to have affected their form, the team could do without the distractions as the title race heats up. City's 1-0 loss at Everton on Tuesday has allowed Manchester United to draw level on points with their neighbours at the top as City's free-scoring ways have dried up a little of late. Whether last season's joint top scorer in the league comes back to help City in their bid for a first league title since 1968 remains to be seen, but he could be happy just picking up a widely reported 200,000 pounds per week for merely training. It could also be in his interest to rejoin his team mates to work on his fitness before the next transfer window when he is once again likely to be the subject of much speculation. "

Kentucky's Terrence Jones jumped over Tennessee's Trae Golden as they scrambled for the ball in the second half. Kentucky (22-1, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) hit its first 11 shots over the opening 11 minutes as the Wildcats won their 14th straight over all. 'A guy like that, they come along once in a lifetime,' Tennessee Coach Cuonzo Martin said of Davis. 'He just changes the game for you.' The Volunteers (10-12, 2-5) were led by Renaldo Woolridge, who made a career-best five 3-pointers and tied his career high with 17 points.

Harris finished with 19 points in Tuesday night's 68-53 loss to the Tar Heels, though eight came in the final 2 minutes after the Demon Deacons had fallen behind by 22 points. The 6-foot-3 junior came in averaging 17.3 points and had been in double figures in every game. But with 6-foot-7 sophomore Reggie Bullock leading the defensive effort, Harris didn't manage his first shot until nearly 8 minutes in ' Bullock blocked it ' and had only four points in the first half. \"That was my main goal, to come out and just play defense hard every game,\" Bullock said. \"I was just trying to make it difficult for him in the first half.\" Harris came in shooting nearly 49 percent from 3-point range, but hit 1 of 6 shots from behind the arc against the Tar Heels. He didn't reach double figures in scoring until hitting two free throws with 5:56 left to cut the deficit to 60-40, then reached his 1,000 career point with a three-point play with 1:03 left. \"(Bullock) does a good job of staying low, getting into you and making every look that you take tough,\" Harris said. For North Carolina, Tyler Zeller had 18 points and a career-best 18 rebounds. North Carolina shot 31 percent, including a 1-for-13 stretch to start the second half before running off a 12-0 spurt to finally pull away. Harrison Barnes added 13 points for the Tar Heels and played most of the second half despite rolling his left ankle midway through the first half. Afterward, coach Roy Williams said Barnes would get a few days off to rest. The Demon Deacons (11-11, 2-6) struggled just as badly as the Tar Heels with their shooting. Wake Forest shot just 30 percent, including 2 for 18 from 3-point range. The game closed a three-game week for the Tar Heels, who beat rival North Carolina State last Thursday then defeated Georgia Tech on Sunday. North Carolina doesn't play again until traveling to Maryland on Saturday, then returns home to face No. 7 Duke next week in the latest renewal of that fierce rivalry. The Tar Heels shot the ball well in the past two wins and hit 10 3-pointers against the Yellow Jackets, but they didn't bring that with them to Winston-Salem. In a sign of what was to come, North Carolina's first three field goals were all second-chance baskets off its own misses, while the Tar Heels shot just 4 for 19 from 3-point range. No North Carolina player shot even 50 percent, while perimeter threats Barnes, Bullock and P.J. Hairston combined to shoot 6 for 26 from the field and miss 11 of 13 3-point tries. Yet the Demon Deacons were in no position to take advantage. They had lost five of six, with the past four losses all coming by at least 11 points. And the Demon Deacons were greeted by plenty of empty green seats and a large splattering of Carolina blue from the stands in their own building for this one. Still, Wake Forest trailed by 12 at halftime and was within 40-34 with about 14 minutes left against the cold-shooting Tar Heels. But Kendall Marshall knocked down a 3-pointer to start the clinching run, then Bullock added his only 3 before Zeller tipped in a miss from Marshall to cap the 12-0 run and give UNC a 60-38 lead with 6:11 left.

        "text": "National Briefing | Southwest: Texas: Judges Skeptical About Legislative Maps It's Hard to Campaign Without a Map (January 27, 2012) Three federal judges who will decide whether the Texas Legislature's new Republican-friendly voting maps violate the Voting Rights Act expressed skepticism on Tuesday about one of the state's core arguments. John Hughes, a lawyer for the state, said in closing arguments before a Washington federal court panel that the maps were a result of legal, partisan gerrymandering that did not violate the law. He argued that 'a decision based on partisanship' was not based on race, even if it results in minority voters having less influence. 'Political motivation is not evidence of racially discriminatory intent,' he said. All three judges expressed doubt about that reasoning. It is hard to explain changes to the map 'other than doing it on the basis of reducing minority votes,' said the presiding judge, Rosemary M. Collyer. The Justice Department and a coalition of minority groups contend that the maps redraw districts in a way meant to dilute the minority voting population. "

        "text": "Giants D-Line a Key vs Brady in Super Bowl INDIANAPOLIS (AP) ' The Giants defense will do everything it can to pressure Tom Brady, and the way the front four has been playing lately it's more a matter of what happens when the pass rush closes in on the Patriots quarterback. \"I think it starts with hitting him, even when you don't actually get sacks, just keeping people around him so he can't step up,\" defensive end Justin Tuck said Tuesday at media day. \"I think he gets a little frustrated when he has to go to his second or third receivers. You can kind of confuse him sometimes with our coverage. I think there are a lot of things that can get him rattled, but it just seems like not too many people are able to do that.\" The Giants have the people to make it happen in Sunday's Super Bowl. In beating the Patriots four years ago in the NFL title game, the Giants sacked Brady five times, hit him nine other times and forced a fumble in their 17-14 upset. In turning around their season with a five-game winning streak to make it to Indianapolis, the Giants (12-7) have allowed a total of 67 points, 13.4 per game, and produced 20 sacks with no opposing quarterback throwing for more than 251 yards ' including Aaron Rodgers of the Packers. \"To be honest, I think our confidence is very high,\" said second-year defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, who led the Giants with 16 sacks in the regular season. \"We know what we have to do and what's at stake. This is our last game, and we're in the Super Bowl. We have to go out and give it our all.\" In their 24-20 win over the Patriots in early November, the Giants sacked Brady twice and had two interceptions. One sack led to a fumble recovery that set up a score. \"We did some things that disrupted his timing,\" defensive coordinator Perry Fewell said. \"We caused him to stay jittery in the pocket. Hopefully we can do that again.\" A lot of changed since that game. Tuck was playing hurt at the time. Osi Umenyiora was still not healthy after missing the start of the season with a knee injury and the defense was still giving up too many big plays. Now, everyone on the defense is healthy. The secondary is covering receivers and the line has finally meshed and is playing its best. Umenyiora has no doubt the Giants will get to Brady. \"They're going to definitely do some things to keep us off of him, max protections, short throws, quick throws, but they can only do that for so long,\" Umenyiora said. \"Whenever we have opportunities where he does hold the ball, we're going to have to get to the quarterback.\" Center Dan Connolly said the Patriots need to keep Brady upright. \"Keeping him from being hit is our No. 1 goal,\" Connolly said. \"If he can stand back there and do his job, we'll be OK.\" Seven-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman and current NFL Network analyst Warren Sapp says the Patriots better establish a running game if Brady is to be successful. \"There is no way they can drop Tom Brady back 40 times and expose him to this rush,\" Sapp said. \"Whoever controls the line of scrimmage wins this ballgame. It's always that simple. If New England can get a run game going, we have a ballgame, If they expose him to the rush when it's third-and-6, third-and-7 and third-and-8, look out. You can't let a defensive lineman pin your ears back.\" And once the Giants' line starts getting to the quarterback, it's contagious. \"You know, the adrenaline is pumping,\" Pierre-Paul said. \"You just have to get there, and like a dunk, you've just got to dunk the ball. Once you do it, you just want another one. Like a sack, once you get one sack, you just want more. The guys on my front line, if Osi gets a sack, I want two sacks, because if I get two sacks, Justin Tuck is going to want three sacks.\" That's what happened in 2008 when a few of the names were different, with the obvious absence being Michael Strahan. \"This game will not be won off what we did in '07 or what we did earlier this year,\" Tuck said. \"I hope we don't fall into that trap of believing that because that team has won 10 straight. They are playing, I think, better football ' team football ' than they played in '07. But, I think we are playing better team football than we played in '07. It's going to be a fun matchup. It's going to be a fun atmosphere, and I am looking forward to it.\" "

        "text": "Peyton Manning Casts Large Shadow Over Super Bowl INDIANAPOLIS (AP) ' For a Manning who isn't in the Super Bowl , this one sure is making headlines. It happened again Tuesday, when Colts quarterback Peyton Manning denied whispers that he was pondering retirement. \"I have no plans on doing that,\" he said. It's the strongest indication that, despite having his third neck operation in September, he hopes to play in the NFL when the new season kicks off later this year ' something the league is happy about. \"My plan hasn't changed,\" he said. The NFL would prefer to keep the focus on this week's juiciest story lines -- Giants quarterback Eli Manning trying to outdo his older brother by winning a second Super Bowl; Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick chasing their fourth titles and maybe exacting a little revenge for their loss to New York four years ago. But as everyone knows, this is Peyton's place, his town, and fans hang on every detail of his recovery. \"It's not the way it should be,\" he said earlier Tuesday in a taped interview with ESPN. The Colts ended their most tumultuous month in more than a decade with another flurry of moves. Team officials confirmed Tuesday that they had hired Bruce Arians, Manning's former quarterbacks coach, as offensive coordinator, and Harold Goodwin as offensive line coach. They also fired tight ends coach Ricky Thomas and assistant offensive line coach Ron Prince. The whirlwind of changes began Jan. 2, the day after the Colts clinched the No. 1 overall draft pick with a league-worst 2-14 record. Irsay has since fired vice chairman Bill Polian, general manager Chris Polian, and dismissed coach Jim Caldwell and most of his staff -- a series of changes that prompted Peyton Manning to voice his complaints two days after the conference championship games. Two days later, Irsay called Manning a \"politician,\" fueling a public spat that drew national attention. The two tried to put out that fire before the team's scheduled arrivals, but the fallout has continued into this week. \"I would think he's very uncomfortable, especially with the Giants here and Eli,\" former Colts coach Tony Dungy said. \"When you get to a Super Bowl, even though it's the second (recent) one for the Giants, you want the focus to be on that achievement. He would much rather have the focus on Eli and what they've done to get here, and unfortunately, that's not going to happen.\" If there were any doubts, they were answered in a strange 24-hour period that began with the host committee's news conference Monday. Irsay joined the mayor, governor and two committee officials to discuss game-week preparations, but wound up taking most of the questions, nearly all of which focused on Manning's future. Afterward, Irsay said he didn't plan to discuss the Manning situation again this week. On Tuesday, Manning piped in. Shortly after the NFL's annual Super Bowl media day event ended, Peyton Manning met with a small group of reporters with the idea of turning the attention back to Sunday's game. \"I'm working hard, I had a really good session today,\" Manning said after repeatedly being asked about his rehab. The four-time league MVP hasn't played in more than a year because of a damaged nerve that caused weakness in his throwing arm. Doctors fused two vertebrae together, a procedure that forced him to miss the Colts two-win season. Since then, there has been rampant speculation about his recovery, the potential risks of a return, whether the Colts will pay Manning a $28 million roster bonus in early March to prevent him from becoming a free agent or whether the soon-to-be 36-year-old might retire.

Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. Republican and Democratic presidents are quite different in their enforcement of tax laws and their administration of the Internal Revenue Service. Republicans are constantly telling us how different they are from the Democrats, and vice versa. But in many ways Republican and Democratic politicians are a lot like Coke and Pepsi ' very different marketing but essentially made of the same chemicals. President Obama, for example, has retained the Republican policy of keeping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. And as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney put into place a state health insurance plan that in many ways resembles the federal Affordable Care Act enacted by a Democratic Congress. Economists have studied the history of policy making by Republican and Democratic presidents. They find a few differences here and there, but for the most part both types of presidents play to the same middle of the country and to many of the same interest groups. But one significant difference between the two parties had been their administration of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency of the United States Treasury that enforces tax rules. A dissertation written in 2005 by Valentin Estevez at the University of Chicago found that: 'Under Democratic presidencies the audit rate of income tax returns is higher than under Republican presidencies even after the inclusion of various political and economic controls.' 'During Democratic presidencies the I.R.S. tends to audit fewer individual returns and more corporate returns than during Republican presidencies.' 'Parties may be in fact resorting to more subtle redistributive policies, such as the likelihood of an audit, to favor their constituency.' I.R.S. data released since Mr. Estevez's dissertation have confirmed the tendencies of Democratic and Republican presidents to use I.R.S. audits differently. Twelve percent of millionaire earners were audited in 2011, when Barack Obama was president, compared with 5 to 7 percent audit rates for 2004-9 (George W. Bush was president most of that time). Among people earning less than $200,000, a far lower percentage of returns are audited (about 1 percent in 2011). Steven Miller, deputy I.R.S. commissioner for services and enforcement, told The Associated Press , in reference to the recent audit rates, that 'I.R.S. officials said the high ratio was part of an effort to demonstrate that tax laws are applied fairly.' If these past audit patterns continue, whether or not millionaires can expect to meet I.R.S. auditors in 2013 and beyond depends a lot on whether President Obama defeats the Republican nominee. audits , Casey B. Mulligan , Daily Economist , Income Tax , Internal Revenue Service , politics , Taxation The Biggest Cut in Unemployment Benefits Why People Pay Income Taxes How to Avoid Reinventing the Wheel on Tax Reform Tackling Income Inequality Previous Post How the Fed Presidents' Assets Stack Up The outcome of the presidential election might help determine how many audits the Internal Revenue Service conducts and whether they're aimed more at individuals or corporations, if historical patterns hold, an economist writes.

        "text": "Residents Vote in Chinese Village at Center of Protest BEIJING ' Less than two months after staging a bold protest against official corruption and chasing away their local leaders, thousands of people in the southern Chinese village of Wukan did something on Wednesday that many once thought unimaginable: They cast ostensibly independent ballots in the first step to determine the leadership of their seaside town in Guangdong Province. The voting Wednesday for a committee to supervise future elections stood as an unlikely grace note marking the peaceful denouement of a standoff against heavily armed security personnel that in many Chinese villages would have ended violently. The 11-day confrontation was diffused in late December, after senior Communist Party officials from the provincial capital reached an agreement with Wukan's self-appointed leaders, promising free elections and an investigation into the questionable real estate deals that locals say have robbed Wukan of much of its arable land. The officials also agreed to fully investigate the death of Xue Jinbo, the 42-year-old village leader who had died in police custody, and to release his body for burial. In another unexpected victory for the town's 13,000 residents, the local Communist Party last month selected one of the protest leaders to be Wukan's party secretary. Wang Yang, the Guangdong Province party chief who helped orchestrate an end to the confrontation, described Wukan's agitation as a quest for fairness and the state-owned People's Daily newspaper trumpeted the resolution as a potential model for officials managing the tensions ' and distrust ' that plague villages across China. 'This tells us that local government must have a keen awareness of prevailing conditions in facing the interest demands of the masses, even if these involve tension and conflict,' the newspaper said in December. But some of the government's promises have been harder to fulfill. Officials have yet to issue a ruling on decades' worth of land sales and they have refused to release Mr. Xue's body until his family signs a statement saying he died of natural causes, relatives said. Although they have been offered generous compensation for their cooperation, the family has refused to comply, insisting that Mr. Xue died while he was being tortured under interrogation in December. Despite the frustration of not being able to bury her father, Xue Jianwan, his 22-year-old daughter, expressed relief that the election promised by provincial officials had taken place. 'All of us in Wukan share the belief that this election marks a significant moment for our village,' Ms. Xue, a school teacher, said by telephone. 'It's the first transparent election we've had in decades, a first step towards true democracy.' The 11-member election committee that Wukan's voters select on Wednesday will be charged with overseeing another election in March that will determine the village leadership. Although some analysts have described the vote as a watershed moment ' one that could influence other villages in rural China ' others were skeptical about the long-term prospects for full-throated democracy, given the Communist Party's stubborn resistance to sharing power. Having been established in the 1980s, local elections for the committees that manage sanitation, social welfare and other daily matters in thousands of villages are not new, but they are widely viewed as flawed. Party officials often determine who ends up on the ballot or they stage-manage and manipulate the voting. Once elected, committee members can be easily swayed by the money that readily flows from township and county-level coffers. It is land sales, the primary source for local government operations, that often prove most corrupting. Wukan residents say it was the former party secretary, Xue Chang, who sold off as much as two-thirds of village's jointly owned land, sharing most of the proceeds with his deputies. Mr. Xue, who held his post since 1970, was removed from office during the throes of the unrest that saw police cars overturned and government offices ransacked. Li Fan, an elections expert who runs the World and China Institute in Beijing, said he thought the best outcome was for an untainted election in Wukan. 'It should be better given that all the media is watching,' he said, referring to the scores of foreign reporters who have flocked to the village. 'If it is a good election, that will be unusual for China.' But Lin Jiang, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, said he hoped that this once-belligerent fishing village could serve as a powerful counterpoint to those who argue that democracy is ill-suited for China's rural citizenry. 'Peasants in China may be undereducated, but the election in Wukan shows that just because you don't have a good education, doesn't mean you can't elect officials to represent your interests,' he said. Yang Semao, a 45-year-old former fisherman who was one of the protest leaders, agreed. Speaking by phone on Wednesday night, he said some residents lacking proper documentation were initially barred from voting but that local officials had come up with a solution that will allow them to vote on Thursday. In all, he said 6,244 ballots were cast. 'One thing I can guarantee is that we will have a fair, impartial and transparent election in March,' he said. 'I'm proud to see the passion for democracy among my fellow villagers. From now on, it's unlikely that anyone will dare rig an election in Wukan.' Shi Da contributed research. "

        "text": "Editorial: A Brave Stand in Rhode Island Jessica Ahlquist, an 11th grader at Cranston High School West in Rhode Island, has endured verbal abuse because, as an atheist, she objected to the 'School Prayer' that has been on the school's auditorium wall since 1963. It is now covered with a tarp after Judge Ronald Lagueux of Federal District Court in Providence properly ruled last month that displaying it violated the First Amendment's prohibition against 'establishment of religion.' Student Faces Town's Wrath in Protest Against a Prayer (January 27, 2012) The anger and hatred directed at Ms. Ahlquist ' she was called 'an evil little thing' on talk radio by a Cranston state representative ' helps explain why the judge, responding to her brave lawsuit, did his duty under the Constitution and ordered immediate removal of the prayer, which begins 'Our Heavenly Father' and concludes 'Amen' and was visible throughout the auditorium. Dozens of speakers at school committee meetings agreed it is a Christian prayer. As Judge Lagueux wrote, 'The guiding principle of Establishment Clause jurisprudence has been government neutrality,' and the prayer fails all tests of neutrality set by the Supreme Court. It was 'clearly religious in nature' when installed. While the school committee's 4-to-3 vote last March to keep it was based partly on its importance to the school's 'history and tradition,' 'no amount' of either 'can cure a constitutional infraction,' the judge wrote. Recent meetings in Cranston about the prayer involved the kind of 'excessive entanglement with religion' the court has warned against, with prayer backers reading from the Bible. The meetings showed why what believers consider a harmless request to respect a prayer can feel like coercion to nonbelievers. As Ms. Ahlquist explained to The Times about her response to the prayer: 'It seemed like it was saying, every time I saw it, 'You don't belong here.' ' The kindness, friendship and other values the prayer champions are universal, but a statement of religious belief has no place in a public high school auditorium. "

        "text": "The Hard Way Out of Afghanistan For years, in the village of Juz Ghoray, at the remote fringes of the Musa Qala District in northern Helmand Province, the Taliban enjoyed free rein, collecting taxes from local poppy farmers and staging attacks on any foreign patrol that moved within shooting range of an abrupt desert prominence called Ugly Hill. After a Marine unit found nine I.E.D.'s hidden beneath Ugly Hill's scarred and caverned faces last year, coalition forces seldom ventured near it. Until one night this October, when members of Echo Company, from the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines ' known since Vietnam as the Magnificent Bastards ' quietly sneaked into Juz Ghoray and posted signs on people's doors and windows. Their idea was to co-opt the infamous Taliban practice of intimidating government sympathizers with night letters threatening execution. The Marines' signs were bordered with the nation's colors, and in Pashto and Dari they announced: 'The Afghan National Security Forces are coming.' Two weeks later, about 60 members of Echo Company, along with 30 Afghan National Army soldiers, traveled on foot through the night and took Ugly Hill without a shot. At dawn, as villagers emerged from their homes, they found laborers stacking bastions to fortify a new Afghan police post. And something else, which many residents of Juz Ghoray had never seen before: an Afghan flag raised on a wooden pole. A Beast in the Heart of Every Fighting Man (May 1, 2011) For the government, the new post represents a palpable extension of its reach, a triumph however modest. But not one without some cost. Before the Afghans could claim Ugly Hill, two marines had to sweep it for mines. Joshua Lee, a 26-year-old sergeant from Arkansas, located the first I.E.D. using a metal detector. As he set to work on the device, Lee identified a second bomb, and while readjusting he stepped on a third. The blast shattered his right leg, cocking it sideways below the knee and leaving mangled pieces of foot hanging loosely from flesh and bone. In the morning, while searching a compound at the base of Ugly Hill, the marines discovered three more fully assembled I.E.D.'s, containing 100 pounds of explosives. When technicians set charges around the bombs, detonating them in place, a six-foot crater was left where one of the compound's buildings had stood. The following evening Echo Company continued south, making camp on a plateau of hard-packed gravel; as the desert night grew frigid, a small convoy arrived to resupply the men with food and water. Turning to climb the steep escarpment, the lead vehicle hit yet another bomb. Its mine-roller ' an extended axle of weighted wheels that tests the ground ahead ' absorbed the brunt of the blast. Walking nearby, a young platoon sergeant, Jacob Maxwell, was knocked off his feet as rocks and wreckage from the obliterated roller struck his legs and back. This was Maxwell's fifth deployment. During a single tour in Iraq in 2006, he survived four I.E.D. explosions. When the dust settled, he was sitting beside the road, cut and bruised, but otherwise unscathed. The corpsman who treated him judged his luck to border on the freakish. Nonetheless, after the attack, Maxwell assured me he'd be leading his platoon on its coming operations. Those will take the company even deeper into Taliban country, to farther-flung villages than Juz Ghoray, among Afghans who, more than 10 years after the government's creation, still lack any meaningful contact with it. 'The Marines are going out into the hinterlands,' Maj. Frank Diorio, the battalion's executive officer, told me. 'They're not tied to any posts. It'll be ongoing until we leave. It's just going to be continuous operations.' The Marines didn't arrive in force in Helmand until 2009. Previously, the British controlled the region. Undermanned, ill equipped and far too thinly spread, they were unable to contain the Taliban revival already proliferating through Helmand by 2006. Only as recently as 2010 did coalition forces, bolstered by Obama's troop surge, try to cauterize what Gen. Stanley McChrystal called the 'bleeding ulcer' of Marja ' a town just outside the provincial capital where the Taliban presided unmolested over a lucrative opium industry. Today the Taliban in Marja have been killed or vanquished to sparsely populated desert regions, and Afghan security forces have assumed most policing responsibilities in the town. Successful as it is, the taking of Marja was accomplished with an immense commitment of men and resources that could not realistically be brought to bear elsewhere in the province. An analogy often invoked across Afghanistan is that of the water-filled bag: squeeze the bottom, the top distends. Accordingly, subdued in Marja and other towns nearer the capital, the fight in Helmand has shifted upriver. There, in places like Kajaki and Sangin and Musa Qala, after 10 years and 821 coalition deaths and thousands of wounded, the insurgency perseveres. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Year after year, month after month, Helmand has ranked as the deadliest, most violent province in Afghanistan. Nowhere else comes close. Growing anxiety over the Pakistani border regions, however, means that America's withdrawal from the country will most likely happen more rapidly in Helmand than in the eastern provinces. During the coming year, the number of marines there will shrink by the thousands; as early as this summer, many Marine positions will be shuttered or handed over to the Afghan Army and the police. No one expects the insurgency to be defeated by then. The issue has long ceased to be how we can decisively expunge the Taliban ' we can't. Instead, the question is: How can we forestall its full-fledged resurgence upon our departure? Toward the end of this year's fighting season, just before the winter rains, I spent seven weeks with marines across much of Helmand, and everywhere the answer was basically the same. First, leave behind a proficient national security force. And second, win them as much breathing room as time allows. The Marines' push into Juz Ghoray was part of this plan. Adhering to a provincewide blueprint for withdrawal, Echo Company had recently closed two of its patrol bases, which in turn permitted longer-range operations, previously impossible, like the taking of Ugly Hill. 'Essentially, we're trying to consolidate American forces and turn over positions to the Afghans in order to facilitate deeper operations,' Lt. Nikolaos de Maria, the platoon's commander, told me shortly after the I.E.D. attacks that injured Lee and Maxwell. 'So the center will be the Afghan Police. The next wave, around that center, will be the Afghan Army. And then for us, we're trying to operate a lot deeper. So that would be a third concentric ring. We would be on the outside, ready for a harder fight.' Later that afternoon, a local man claimed that insurgents had buried three I.E.D.'s in the dry riverbed crossed by the marines on their way to Juz Ghoray. After they found and detonated one of the bombs, several marines stayed to watch the area during the night. In the morning they were attacked by machine guns and artillery clattering from unseen positions to the east. Hearing the exchange back at Ugly Hill, de Maria rallied the rest of his platoon and the Afghan Army soldiers. As they donned their flak jackets and shouldered their radios and loaded their carbines, the men were charged by the usual electricity ' but there was something else too: relief at the promise of actually confronting whoever had been trying so hard to blow them up. 'We're bringing the hammer,' de Maria said over the radio. Cpl. Brandon Sisson led the platoon down the hill and through the deserted village. Thin and scrappy, with a penchant for brawling, Sisson should have been a sergeant, but in Iraq his promotion stalled after he broke another marine's jaw so badly he needed to be evacuated to a hospital in Germany. Now, at 23, with a wife and a child and another on the way, Sisson claimed to have mellowed with age. When we emerged into farmland, more shots rang out and the marines found cover where they could. As we lay flat on our stomachs in the wet mire of a tilled poppy field, Sisson shook his head. 'I liked Iraq a lot better,' he said. 'You could actually see them.' Just then two Afghan soldiers strutted by holding their weapons like folded umbrellas. They seemed entirely unconcerned by the fact that people were shooting at us. I recognized one of them. In lieu of a rifle, he humped a rucksack full of rocket-propelled grenades. The marines loved him for this and had nicknamed him R.P.G. Others were less popular: because they were lazy, because they complained, because they smelled, because they stole, because way too often they were way too stoned ' the list of grievances ran long. In the end, though, what mattered most was that one item never made the list: cowardice. They delighted in fighting. If you had to name the principal difference between Afghan soldiers and United States marines, it might best be summarized as 'discipline.' Marines are existentially defined by it; Afghans have little concept of it. The previous day, I accompanied a patrol through Juz Ghoray with an Afghan Army squad that insisted on searching the first compound we came to. Sgt. Adam Sweet, the marine overseeing the patrol, was surprised. It was early, we had a long way to go and nothing about the place appeared especially suspicious. 'This one?' he asked the Afghan squad leader. 'Yes, this one,' the Afghan said. 'We must search this one now.' Sweet had become a marine by accident. After being arrested for driving while stoned, he dropped out of college during his first semester, was evicted from his apartment and soon found himself back in Nebraska, living with his mom. There he met a girl who invited him to go with her back to Fort Collins, Colo., where she attended school. Sweet went. Six months later the girl pledged a sorority and announced she was moving in with her new sisters. 'I didn't know what to do,' Sweet told me. 'So I ended up getting drunk one night and told myself that I should join the Air Force. I showed up in the morning to join the Air Force, and they were closed. So I walked next door to the Marine recruiting office and signed the paperwork.' A year and a half later, Sweet was carrying a machine gun through the streets of Fallujah. In Juz Ghoray, he shrugged and followed the Afghan soldiers into the compound. No one was home. As Sweet scrupulously searched room after room ' opening ornate chests, shaking out heavy blankets, rifling through piles of hay, sniffing plastic fuel jugs ' I noticed one of the Afghans hurry across the courtyard with a large propane tank. Then another ran by carrying a metal cooking pot. Finally came a third, making a basket of his shirt that bulged with fresh eggs. A few minutes later, Sweet and I found the whole squad huddled in the livestock pen. A shaggy-haired soldier sporting a Che-style beret grinned at us a little sheepishly. 'Breakfast?' he said. Now, as bullets clapped toward us in the muddy poppy field, R.P.G. gave a thumbs up. 'Taliban good!' he said. Corporal Sisson returned the gesture. 'Hopefully, Taliban dead.' We pushed past a cornfield toward another village farther east. Whole families were running away. Sisson noticed, on a distant ridge, the silhouette of a lone figure and the glint of something metal catch the sun. 'We got a spotter,' he told de Maria. Bullets kicked the dirt near several of the marines, and the platoon pressed through the village to a wide, white-rocked creek on its other side. This was as far as they were authorized to go. From the edge of an eroding embankment that dropped precipitously, the marines watched a train of people fleeing toward the eastern hills. The figure on the ridge vanished, and soon two men on motorcycles appeared among the villagers. 'They're screening themselves with the women and kids,' Sisson said. As the marines struggled to find a clear line of sight on the men with motorcycles, someone peeled away from the exodus and began walking toward us. It was a young boy, maybe 9 or 10, and he trailed a voluminous black scarf held high above his head. The cloth flapped in the hot wind. Sisson spat. 'They're doing this on purpose.' The boy walked all the way to the creek, where he seemed to waver, regarding the marines and the Afghan soldiers shouting at him to stop, turn around, get out of the way. Then he kept coming. He crossed the stream; he scaled the embankment; he passed right through the ranks of frantically yelling soldiers. All the while he held up his scarf as if it were a flag. The men on motorcycles came and went: now picking people up, now dropping others off ' tauntingly, or so it felt. Soon the sun began to dim. It made of the men vague shapes receding deeper into a country where they knew the marines could not follow. When I looked around for the boy, he was gone, too. The men on motorcycles and the train of villagers fled in the direction of Kajaki, a small district on the Helmand River connected to Musa Qala via a Taliban-controlled road riddled with karez (ancient underground aqueducts, which insurgents sometimes use to transport people and equipment). Over the years, Kajaki has been reduced to a ghost town. From the tops of the mountains that form its spacious valley, the village looks like a kind of postapocalyptic tableau: uncultivated fields and the ruins of razed homes; abandoned roads pocked by blasts from I.E.D.'s; the uprooted stumps of bulldozed trees; the ransacked, shuttered stalls of what used to be a large bazaar; and roving packs of jackals that fill the empty nights with a mournful howling. But even as the people have absconded, the fight in Kajaki has raged on. It has raged on because the fight has never really been about the people. It has been about the dam. The Kajaki Dam, made of terraced earth rising more than 300 feet, blocks a narrow ravine in the upper Helmand River to form a massive lake whose bays and fingers reach deep into sheer-walled coulees. Controlled outflow from the lake provides electricity for much of southern Afghanistan and irrigates more than half a million acres of farmland. It has the potential to do much more. 'It's only operating at really 30 percent,' Cpt. Matt Ritchie, commanding officer of the last Marine battery in charge of the area, told me. Hundreds of tons of concrete are needed to install an additional turbine that will bring the power output nearer to capacity. Although a major road links Kajaki to Camp Leatherneck, the provincial headquarters for the Marines, until recently it was far too dangerous to transport the material. 'Because of the dam,' Ritchie explained, 'Kajaki is significant. But this is the one district that's cut off. We didn't have any connection to any other districts within 20 kilometers.' Last October, the Marines commenced what might prove to have been their last major offensive in Afghanistan, with the aim of ending Kajaki's isolation. While an infantry battalion breached the district from the south, two platoons from Ritchie's battery were inserted by helicopters into its northern woodland, long held by the Taliban. 'We put a fence in the dirt, literally,' one platoon commander told me. 'Put concertina wire down and said, 'You're not going to get north of this area.' Between the two fronts of marines, the officer said, 'during the three to four days that we were there, I think we killed about 30 of them. They quit picking up their casualties.' The sole escape for the insurgents was to ford the Helmand River and disappear into Zamindawar, an ungoverned desert extending from the dam to the foothills of a towering mountain range several miles north. 'And they did exactly that,' the platoon commander said. 'That's the Wild West up there. We won't ever go up there.' When I arrived in Kajaki in early November, a few families had begun trickling back to the villages below the dam, returning for the first time after six years to find out whether their homes might still be standing. By then, Captain Ritchie was finishing up his seven-month deployment and a new unit had just arrived to begin theirs. Now that the road from Camp Leatherneck was secure, the incoming marines were focused on 'developing the Afghan National Security Forces and getting them to own the battle space, to protect the dam,' the new commander said. In fact, there is a good chance the marines in Kajaki will be gone altogether by this summer. If that happens, the Afghan police officers and soldiers who are left behind will quite likely face a tough fight as the insurgents living in Zamindawar move to exploit their increased vulnerability. Of the several posts the Afghans will inherit, the least tenable will be one called the Shrine, the only Marine position north of the Helmand River, perched atop a small hill, on the frontier of the Wild West. About a half-dozen Afghan policemen shared the Shrine with a squad of marines, who rotated in and out. Perhaps because of the forced intimacy of the tiny outpost and the shared experience of coming under constant attack, the marines and Afghans stationed there enjoyed an uncommonly functional, even fraternal, relationship. They knew one another's names, shared responsibilities, laughed and joked and sometimes ate together. All of the police officers on the Shrine were Tajiks or Uzbeks from northern Afghanistan who said they enlisted and came to the Pashtun south because they believed in their country and its government; they were nationalists. Their commander was a gaunt middle-aged Uzbek named Ghulam Jalani. Over several meals of rice and lamb in the cramped hut where his men quarter, Jalani expressed deep admiration for the Marines. He also fears for the day they go home. 'I am not an educated man,' Jalani told me one night. 'In fact, I am illiterate. But I tell you: if the Marines leave here, the Taliban will come back.' The following morning, a squad from the new unit showed up for its first week at the Shrine. The squad leader, 25-year-old Erick Granados, is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated to the United States from El Salvador. Built like a wrestler and covered in tattoos, he is also the shortest man in the platoon. Even by Marine standards, Granados is deeply, almost fanatically, patriotic. One of the things he brought with him to Afghanistan was a large American flag. Upon arriving at the Shrine, while his squad was still unpacking, Granados climbed onto a bunker roof and planted the flag between two sandbags. It was a surprisingly potent image ' something you rarely see in Afghanistan, where the U.S. deliberately fights the stigma of an occupying force by framing its activities as strictly ancillary to the national government. I would learn that marines from the previous battery also had a flag. Invariably, they said, whenever it went up, the Shrine came under attack. This time, the insurgents waited until dark, firing on the outpost with automatic weapons a little before midnight. Jalani and the other Afghan police officers sprinted to their machine guns in sandals and T-shirts, spraying bullets haphazardly into the dark. Using thermal optics, Granados was able to locate two men as they descended into a narrow canyon that snakes through an area called Chinah in the Taliban-occupied country north of the Shrine. After calling in illumination rounds that burned slow trails through the night, radiating pools of incandescence across the black expanse, the marines concentrated several volleys on the canyon. Staff Sgt. Vincent Bell seized the opportunity to observe a policeman firing a PK machine gun. Bell had deployed four times to Iraq, but this was his first tour in Afghanistan. As the policeman, pausing now and then to ash the cigarette that hung loosely from his mouth, showered a fusillade of bullets in the general vicinity of the canyon, Bell cried out: 'You boys are raw! I mean raw, raw, raw! ' The Afghan gave him a quizzical look, as if uncertain whether he was being chastised. 'Don't get me wrong,' Bell told him. 'I like it!' Eventually, the gunshots petered out. But a couple of hours later, a marine noticed two men digging with shovels near the road that connects the Shrine to the main base at the dam. He alerted Sergeant Granados, who magnified their images using a remote-controlled camera mounted atop a tower that relays infrared video to a monitor at its base. After watching the men excavate a hole, place an object inside and bury it, Granados radioed his superiors and requested permission to shoot them. The permission was denied. 'They want to see components,' Granados complained. 'They want to see wires, jugs. We saw something getting put into the ground. To them, that isn't good enough.' The marines watched the men toss a handful of branches over their project, then flee quickly back to Chinah. Intermittent gun battles continued until dawn, when the sun bloomed from behind a series of serrated ridgelines, and the whole wasted valley ' the cattails that crowd the river's banks, the yellow pastures where ragged camels graze, the wind-bent corn against the western desert ' emerged in bright relief. I was drinking tea with Jalani when two trucks, loaded with farmworkers heading out to harvest the last of the year's crop, came bumping down the road leading to the outpost. As they reached the place where the two men were seen digging in the night, a tremendous explosion echoed off the hills and the trucks vanished in a geyser of erupted earth. Thirteen passengers, including women and children, had been crammed into the trucks, but somehow none were killed or badly hurt. A few minutes later, carrying satchels and tools, the Afghans continued toward their fields on foot. 'Where are they going?' I asked Jalani. That afternoon, another squad from Granados's platoon, led by Sgt. Samuel Windisch, conducted its first foot patrol in Kajaki, north and west from the Shrine, into an area called the brown zone, where lawless Zamindawar abuts the territory controlled by the Marines. The purpose of the patrol, Windisch told me, was 'to test the enemy's forward line of engagement. We're looking for a fight, basically.' In 2005, Windisch was shot by a sniper in Fallujah. The bullet caught the upper right corner of his chest plate, knocking him down with a force that he said felt like someone hitting him with a sledgehammer. He re-enlisted nonetheless, and two years later he did another tour in the same city. When I asked whether the outgoing marines offered him any advice about the route he planned to take today, Windisch replied, 'Yeah: 'You're gonna get shot at.' ' Following behind Joshua Gray, a young lance corporal who swept the path for I.E.D.'s, Windisch and his squad headed for Devon Hill, a steep knoll jutting from the western desert. Passing through the coalition-friendly village of Kanzi, we came to a dirt road where Gray noticed something that made him stop. Extending across the road ' almost like a border ' several neatly stacked stones had been arranged in a perfect line. The bomb-sniffing dog was sent forward to investigate; when it detected no explosives, the marines pressed on. Later, Windisch would wonder whether the stones marked what he called 'the flip, literally the line in the sand,' delineating the place where insurgents still prevailed. After rounding the northern slope of Devon Hill, the marines glimpsed for the first time what lay on the other side: mud-mortar homes crowding the edge of a meandering gulch, women hanging laundry out to dry, children chasing one another over rooftops, men reaping fields of wheat with scythes ' entire communities, not a quarter-mile from the Shrine, cut off from the Afghan government, untouched by its laws, its army and police. Soon Gray halted the patrol once more. This time he spotted the barely visible edge of what appeared to be a piece of hand-carved wood poking out among some rocks. A corporal with a long-handled sickle joined Gray at the front and lightly scored the earth around it. The ground there was rough and the sickle blade accidentally bumped the object loose. What came up was a carefully constructed apparatus consisting of a cylinder and a sharpened dowel: a nonmetallic pressure switch. If depressed, the wooden spike would have struck a highly combustible powder that would have activated a detonation cord, triggering a main charge ' a plastic fuel jug packed with homemade explosive ' buried deeper underground. After recovering the first one, Gray spotted a second, identical wooden switch barely protruding a few feet away. While Windisch and his executive officer, First Lt. Terence Sawick, reported Gray's find to headquarters and plotted their next move, the squad's Afghan interpreter, a soft-spoken and frail-framed young man, whom I'll call Mukhtar (he doesn't want it known among Afghans that he works with Americans), nervously surveyed the village. Mukhtar had been working with the Marines in Kajaki ever since they succeeded the British. His English was impeccable, the best of any linguist I've encountered in Afghanistan. (He told me he perfected the language by listening to the speeches of Barack Obama.) For more than two years, Mukhtar had been away from his family in Kabul. He earned $865 a month, but what kept him in Kajaki was the hope of someday earning a visa to enter the United States. Now, with unsettling emphasis, he turned to me and whispered, 'This is a bad place to stop.' Before I could ask why, Windisch called out to his squad, 'We're going home.' And as Gray turned east, cutting across the broad face of Devon Hill, a barrage of gunfire converged on us. It came from several directions, multiple compounds, some close and others far. Bullets zipped past, making the high-pitched cartoon sound of buttons popping off a fat man's coat, the singing of taut wire. Some smacked the ground around our feet, raising small puffs of dust and cracking into rocks. 'Get down! Get down!' A sharp declivity separated the rear of the patrol from those farther up the hill. Cpl. Michael Subu, the assistant squad leader (recently promoted to sergeant), yelled at the marines pinned below to bound for higher ground. 'Get up here now!' The bullets continued in bursts, snapping overhead; each enemy position had at least one machine gun. Spotting muzzle flashes, the marines sited their rifles on 'murder holes,' narrow gaps in compound walls designed to accommodate barrels aimed from the inside out. Someone spotted four men with AK-47's rushing through a house less than 50 yards away. Subu delivered a rapid series of rounds through its windows as his team moved uphill behind him. Unable to lay his heavy weapon on the downward grade, Joshua Donald, the squad's 22-year-old machine-gunner, brought it to his hip and directed a steady stream of automatic fire toward another compound farther north. Windisch and Sawick radioed headquarters, asking for artillery support. But the squad was situated in between the targets and the mountains from which the howitzers and mortars would be fired. If ordnance fell short, it could land on the marines. 'We gotta move!' Subu called. Gray stood up and began quickly sweeping a path with the metal-detector down the east side of the hill. The marines followed as closely as they could while kneeling, reloading and returning fire to the north. As the slope leveled off into short, tilled terraces, a new sound joined the melee: heavy weaponry clattering from somewhere high above us. 'What is that?' 'It's the Shrine!' From up on the outpost, about a quarter-mile away, Granados radioed Windisch and asked him to mark a target. Windisch aimed his rifle-mounted grenade-launcher at one of the compounds where he'd seen consistent muzzle flashes. The grenade slammed into the compound wall, blowing open its metal door. A moment later, the marines on the Shrine unleashed a rain of ammunition. Not far from the bottom of the terraces stood a low, mud-mortared wall. But to get there, we had to cross an open field in full view of the gunmen. Over the field, bullets audibly split the air. Gray popped two canisters of smoke and tossed them in the dirt. As the yellow clouds poured out, meeting in a thick, obscuring pall, the squad sprinted for the wall. Crouching behind it, Subu recognized more insurgents shooting from a tree line a couple hundred meters off. Windisch shouldered a rocket launcher, and we ducked and plugged our ears as its blast threw debris against us. The rocket soared long, exploding just beyond the trees. 'We're moving!' Sawick yelled. 'Keep moving!' One last stretch of exposed terrain remained, a shallow wadi we had crossed to get to Devon Hill. When Sawick, Windisch and Subu stepped into the streambed, a burst from a machine gun nearly took them out. Bullets skipped off the stones around them, ricocheting past their heads. By now, the marines on the Shrine had intercepted enemy radio communications: two insurgents were moving heavy guns to flank us from behind. 'Keep going!' Sawick urged. The enemy fire followed us all the way to Kanzi, despite incessant pounding from the Shrine. When we finally reached the village, a group of farmers were standing outside, surrounded by children. The men cheered and gave thumbs-up to the marines, while the children ran to them, pleading for chocolate. Sawick had Mukhtar tell the eldest of the men to lead us the rest of the way. The farmer was understandably reluctant. Sawick insisted, and the marines fell in behind him as he guided us through the fields, turning unexpectedly, zigzagging this way and that, following some unmarked route he knew by heart. At the base of the Shrine, the marines lighted cigarettes and congratulated one another. Except for Staff Sergeant Bell, Sergeant Windisch and Corporal Subu, it was the squad's first taste of combat. As a 22-year-old in Kunar Province, Subu was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism during the winter of 2008, after he jumped into a freezing river, while suffering from hypothermia, to rescue his drowning squad leader. While the younger marines now laughed and joked, giddy with adrenaline, Subu turned to Windisch and shook his head. 'That was close,' he said. With a little bit of wonder, as though unsure what to make of it, Windisch told him, 'It's been six years since I fired my rifle at somebody.' I looked around for Mukhtar and found him standing by himself, apart from the others. He removed his helmet and spread his bandanna on the ground, then got to his knees. As more gunshots came from the north, and the marines on the Shrine answered in kind, Mukhtar bowed and muttered, praying toward an orange sun setting over Devon Hill. That night was unusually quiet in Kajaki. According to village scuttlebutt, five Taliban had been killed. 'I think we gave them enough hell for a while,' Windisch predicted. But the next evening several Afghan policemen found a fight on the riverbank, and in the morning Granados raised his flag again. In fact, he climbed onto the bunker roof and waved it at the northern desert before planting it in place. I was eating breakfast with one of the younger marines, who laughed and said, 'It's about to get crackin'!' Fifteen minutes later, an 82-millimeter mortar round whistled over our heads and slammed into the hillside, unearthing a small crater not far from the half-sunken pipe that the squad urinated into. After the ambush on Devon Hill, the marines suspended further patrols into the north. 'There's no tactical advantage to going up there other than getting in a firefight,' one officer told me. 'We can spend another 10 years in Afghanistan and still be fighting like that. We have to look at the bigger picture, which is turning all of this over to the Afghans.' My last night on the outpost, I had dinner with Ghulam Jalani. 'We need the Marines to stay here,' he told me again. 'We might not be able to defend this area.' Indeed, it's hard to imagine a half-dozen Afghans holding onto the Shrine without the camera tower, the thermal optics, the high-powered binoculars, the heavy machine guns, the illumination rounds, the sniper rifles and the nearby mortars and howitzers that the Marines need to defend it now. It's also hard to imagine that, deprived of these assets, Jalani and his men would not choose to return north, where their wives and children wait for them, instead of risking their lives for a Pashtun population that doesn't speak their language. After dinner, one of the policemen loitered near my cot, watching me pack my bag. He seemed to be working up the nerve to speak. Finally, I asked him what he wanted. He explained that the days were getting cold now, and he had no socks. A week and a half later, Staff Sgt. Vincent Bell stepped on an I.E.D. and was killed. When I heard about Bell, I was shocked to learn that he was 28 ' my age. I assumed he was much older. He enlisted after high school, a few months before 9/11, and participated in the invasion of Iraq. He did four tours in the worst of that place. With Bell, as with so many marines, war had accelerated his maturation in ways both physical and psychic. On patrol he was exceedingly apprehensive about I.E.D.'s. You had the sense he had seen too much not to be ' that is, he knew that apprehensive was the only prudent state of mind. I walked behind him twice, and he was by far the most cautious of any marine I followed. He took no chances. He did everything he was supposed to do. In a combat zone, each of a variety of threats instills its own corresponding fear. Unique to the fear of I.E.D.'s is a sense of powerlessness. For marines, this fear, above every other, rates the most acute. Forgoing tactical formations, they often walk in single file behind engineers with metal-detectors. They overturn suspicious rocks with hooks affixed to bamboo stalks. They mark every turn with lines of shaving cream or baby powder in the dirt. They travel over rooftops, laying ladders across alleys to cross from house to house. After dark they leave a trail of chemically treated Q-tips that glow under night-vision goggles. And they study every step they take for signs of tampered ground. But despite these precautions, there remains a limit to the degree of safety that vigilance affords, and ultimately it is chance that kills or spares you. This fear ' the fear of chance and your helplessness to affect it ' is a constant companion to the grunts conducting daily foot patrols across the bomb-littered country of northern Helmand. Nowhere has the I.E.D. been put to deadlier and more ubiquitous use than in Sangin, a central transit hub on the Helmand River just south of Kajaki. Home to the province's second-largest bazaar, an entrenched drug economy and a connecting route to Kandahar and Pakistan, Sangin has inspired the Taliban's fiercest resistance throughout the war. Between 2006 and 2010, the British lost 106 soldiers there. When the Marines took over, with larger numbers, they aggressively took the fight to the enemy, pushing hard into areas the Brits had shunned. 'It was Vietnam,' a former platoon commander told me. 'Every day we were fighting for our lives.' The next Marine unit deployed to Sangin lost 25 men, with more than 200 wounded: the heaviest toll by far of any American battalion since the beginning of the war. Today the fight in Sangin has changed; knowing they will always lose, the insurgents who remain seldom ambush the marines, or engage them with small arms. Rather, they rely almost entirely on I.E.D.'s ' and at this they have grown terribly adept. Most of the bombs in Sangin are fashioned from materials with a low-enough metallic signature to go unnoticed by hand-held detectors. Plastic jugs filled with potassium chlorate, a few nine-volt batteries offset from the charge, old speaker wire connecting to a pressure plate of wood and copper, anti-tamper devices made with clothespins, brake lights or hypodermic needles and improvised blasting caps ' this is all you need. In October, the same unit that replaced the British in 2010, the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, returned to Sangin for another tour. I visited them toward the end of November, and already four marines had been killed by I.E.D.'s, with another 17 severely injured, 10 of them amputees. The prevalence of hidden explosives, the daily fact of them, has engendered in the war-weary residents of Sangin a kind of defiant apathy. My first day in the district, I arrived at a small base shortly after a squad of marines had left on a routine patrol. About 600 meters outside the wire a young boy stopped them to point out the location of a nearby I.E.D. I was in a tent with the platoon commander, who found the squad on the remote-controlled camera and zoomed in on the boy. He looked about 12. 'He wants to bring it to us,' the squad leader radioed back to the lieutenant. 'No,' the lieutenant told him. 'Do not do that.' But the boy had already bounded off, retrieved something from the tall grass and was carrying it back to the marines. 'It's just the pressure plate,' the squad leader said over the radio. And then: 'Correction. He has the whole I.E.D.' The marines yelled: 'Put it down! Put it down!' Eventually the boy tossed the device ' a jug, plate, wires ' roughly to the ground. He seemed to do it with a shrug. The lieutenant shook his head and told me this had happened several times before. A few days later, I accompanied a patrol with another squad, led by First Lt. Matt Perry, during which we were invited into a compound by a young man caked from head to toe with splattered mud. The man, Kareem Dada, was building additional walls for his home, which he'd recently inherited from his father. Nearby, as he and Perry spoke, Kareem's 9-year-old brother leaned on a pair of old crutches, shifting his weight from armpit to armpit, adjusting the burden on his single leg. Three months ago, the boy and two other brothers had triggered an I.E.D. while playing in an alley near their house. The blast killed one boy and badly maimed the two survivors, who were taken to Camp Leatherneck for surgery. On their way to see them, racing along the Helmand River, Kareem's parents crashed their car and died. 'Who do you blame?' Perry wanted to know. 'The Taliban,' Kareem answered automatically. 'I hate them. Look at what they did to us.' As the marines left the compound, they found the third brother, who was maybe 13, waiting outside in a wheelchair. Both of his legs were amputated above the knees. He glared at us with naked loathing. He cursed us in English as we passed. Back at the base, I asked Perry why he thought the third brother's attitude toward the marines had been so different from Kareem's. The lieutenant held up his hands. Maybe they weren't who they said they were. Maybe Kareem's whole story was a fabrication and they'd been involved in placing an I.E.D. that accidentally detonated. This felt plausible, if disturbing. But then Perry offered another explanation, which seemed to suggest a paradox inherent to any counterinsurgency: 'They feel like if we weren't here, bombs wouldn't be in the ground.' When the Americans replaced the British, there were only a few patrol bases outside of the battalion headquarters, and each was perilously embattled. Since then the Marines have established dozens of positions throughout Sangin and driven the Taliban from the district center. This, however, has not completely prevented insurgents from carrying out attacks. 'The bottom line with the enemy we're facing is that he's in civilian clothes, he's riding a motorcycle and he's unarmed,' Lt. Col. Seth Folsom, the Marines' battalion commander, told me. 'The way he operates is through the use of caches. He'll move from one cache to another, get the materials he needs and emplace I.E.D.'s that way.... They know we're not going to just start mowing down guys on motorcycles. So even though we cast a wide net, a lot of fish still get through.' Most of the caches are believed to be scattered through desert regions beyond the district center, particularly to the east, near the border of Kandahar. From there, components are smuggled piecemeal ' a jug one day, a pressure switch the next ' and only later assembled in Sangin proper. 'If you know how to put one together,' Folsom explained, 'it literally takes minutes, if not seconds. If we catch them in the act, we can drop ordnance on them. But if they get away, we'll track them out to the east until we eventually lose sight of them.' Until recently, the Marines, distributed among their many fixed positions, lacked the manpower to go after these caches and disrupt insurgents infiltrating from the east. But as in Musa Qala and elsewhere, they have now begun handing over posts to the Afghans, freeing up personnel for operations 'in the hinterlands.' While I was in Sangin, the first Marine patrol base was formally transitioned to the Afghan National Army. Later that week, also for the first time, an entire company moved east ' and kept on going all the way to Kandahar. For four days they hiked the desert, sweltering in the afternoon and bitter cold at night, sleeping in villages, searching each house and hole they crossed. They had anticipated opposition, but they found instead a conspicuous, almost eerie, absence of military-age men. 'It's like when you turn on the lights, the cockroaches all disappear,' Folsom said one afternoon. 'When you turn off the lights, they all come right back out.' No insurgents, only traces of them everywhere. One day, searching a compound far from any village, the marines discovered four jugs of explosives, rolls of white speaker wire, casings from U.S. illumination rounds (scavenged for employment as projectiles) and several radio transmitters used as remote detonators. The last were especially worrisome. The battalion had yet to encounter remotely detonated I.E.D.'s in Sangin. 'What this indicates to me is that if they're not using remote-control devices in our sector, they will be soon,' Folsom said ' and they have in fact encountered them since I left. Two days later, on a sandy ledge, one of the technicians registered something with his metal detector. A sergeant probed around the ground with his knife and exhumed a bulky object wrapped in tire rubber. Cutting through the rubber and the patterned cloth beneath it, the sergeant unveiled a Russian-made machine gun; as he assembled its parts, another marine, farther up the bank, called out, 'I got something else here.' It was an AK-47 buried just below the surface. A couple of minutes later, several loaded magazines were found. Then a burlap sack containing 130 pounds of ammonium nitrate. Then a plastic bag with 17 pounds of a mixture of aluminum nitrate and ammonium powder. Then some pressure plates. Then two-way radios used as triggering devices. Then carbon rods, detonation cord, blasting caps and speaker wire. Very close to the caches stood a compound. The day before, the marines asked the owner if they could spend the night inside his walls. The owner, who struck some as suspiciously hostile, refused. By the time the caches were discovered, he was gone. Another local, anothernight, welcomed the entire company into his compound. As 70-odd marines unrolled their sleeping bags in the compound's dirt courtyards among goats, cows and chickens, the Afghan security forces drank tea and shared peanut butter and crackers with the host and several of his sons in a small mud room. Haji Abdul Rahim, the ruddy, bright-eyed owner of the compound, turned out to be a Koranic healer: in exchange for livestock, he treated illnesses and injuries by reciting over them appropriate passages from the Muslim holy book. That night we stayed up late, listening to Rahim speak of miracles. His grandfather had been a revered spiritual leader in Sangin. After he died and was buried in a cemetery not far from Rahim's home, wild deer would regularly visit the slab of white stone that marked his grave. Faithful from all across Afghanistan traveled to Sangin to pay tribute. This was in the 1980s, during the jihad, and when the Soviets learned of the burial site's magic and the pilgrims it attracted, they dispatched a helicopter to destroy it. A bullet struck the grave marker, piercing the white stone, and from that place issued a slow line of blood. The stone still bleeds today, Rahim insisted, continually replenishing a deep pool at its base. 'In this country, you will see many strange things,' Rahim said, holding up a finger. 'Lots of miracles happen here.' At dawn, as the marines rolled up their bags and shouldered their rucksacks, Rahim approached the company commander. One of his daughters was in pain. She'd twisted her ankle and it was badly swollen. Did the marines have any medicine? A corpsman dug out a few Ibuprofen, for which Rahim was very grateful. On a recent afternoon at Camp Leatherneck, I met with Maj. Gen. Michael Toolan, the commander of coalition forces in southwest Afghanistan. We sat on a porch outside his office, and at one point during our conversation, General Toolan gestured at the steel I-beams of a half-erected building up the way. 'Look at this place,' he said. 'It's just being built. We're not going anywhere. Yes, we're not going to be conducting the kind of operations that we're conducting today. But we're not leaving. I bring all kinds of people over here for meetings. I say: 'See that new construction over there? How long do you think that's gonna last? Twenty-five, 30 years?' ' To be sure, the United States will try to keep some kind of presence in Afghanistan long after 2014. Big bases might remain; trainers and advisers might come and go; special operations forces might continue to carry out targeted 'kill-capture' raids. But conventional forces are coming home. And when that happens, the weird end will almost certainly pass unheralded by any declaration of victory or admission of defeat. Because the war in Afghanistan, almost certainly, will not be over. It will go on without us. Nobody knows how it will evolve. It's easy to be pessimistic ' but pessimism, too, assumes some insight into a future that has seemed recently to become more, not less, opaque. 'People ask me all the time, 'Can the Afghan National Security Forces hold what we've got and maintain security?' ' General Toolan told me. 'I say, absolutely: they're better-trained, better-equipped and better-liked than the insurgency. They can do it. However, what is important is their will. Their will is a function of their leadership. And their leadership is oftentimes susceptible to corruption.' This perhaps would be the greatest tragedy of all: if the gains earned in Helmand by the coalition since 2006 were lost because of a lack of will. For what would the British and Americans have sacrificed so much? To what end would we be able to say 821 of them gave their lives? Before I left Sangin, I attended a memorial service for two marines who were killed a week earlier by an I.E.D. The centerpiece of any memorial for a marine is the formal construction of his battle cross. The rifle stuck bayonet down, the helmet set atop the butt stock, the dog tags draped on the pistol grip, the boots placed on the ground. The end result is a movingly personlike assemblage of the dead man's essential gear. What holds it all together is the rifle. Clearly, the rifle is meant to symbolize a kind of linchpin ' the singularly vital thing. Yet somehow, it is the boots, their laces neatly looped and tied, that are most affecting. It is the boots, not the rifle, that most evoke an absence. It is the boots that young marines reach out to touch when they kneel before it all.  "
